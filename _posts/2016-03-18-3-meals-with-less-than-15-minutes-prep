In the past couple of weeks, my life has gotten exponentially crazy.

Like, unusually crazy.

I have been pretty quiet about this on here so far, but my career is such a big part of my life that it has been increasingly difficult to keep quiet about. Moving to Pittsburgh has been a huge change in my life, not just for the obvious reasons of moving to a new place that is so far from my home, but also for my career. Although I am happy with my previous experience, I realized after trying to work in an office for a year and a half that it was not the right setting for me. I thrive with variety and staying in one place for too long just drove me insane. 

So moving was a perfect excuse to recreate my career. After many months of informational interviews, market research, and sending my resume everywhere, I have decided to merge my engineering background with my love of learning through writing. **I have taken a contract as a Technical Writer doing research for a university, and have been absolutely loving it!**

From here on out, the plan is for me to be freelancing for both online and local contacts. In order to be more professional, I am also working on registering my own business. It’s kind of crazy to say and it is not what I thought I would be doing, but it is turning out to be the best thing! I’m enjoying using my mind in a really challenging way while also having a flexible schedule.

My calendar has started to really pick up lately, which is great, but also means that I have a very different and much fuller schedule to balance!

How does all of this relate to food, health, and the EWE community? I promise I am not just babbling for the sake of it, but I really think this is relevant.

I have said this before, but I want to emphasize it again: your health is inextricably connected with your mental and emotional states of well-being too. Although career isn’t everything, it does affect your life significantly, whether we want to admit that or not. I think we all know this, but it is impossible to comprehend until you are removed from the situation a bit. Until I stepped out of my job for a time, I did not realize the extent of how it was affecting me and only then could I have clarity about what direction to take next.

All this to say that it really is worth taking a long, hard look at your life to figure out what….. If you are in that sort of time, then I implore you to cut back on anything you can. Sure, not everyone can take 3 months off like I did. But there are ways you can turn this season of life into a contemplative one, by simplifying anything you can and cutting out extra activities.

**Cheat Meals**

<br>

For those of you in a season like this, or a busy season, or who just want some simple meals, I have created this list of ridiculously easy meals that have made my dinners much easier. These are the three meals that have been on rotation in my meal plan probably a bit too much lately. :) But hey, whatever gets you through the tough times and keeps me eating vegetables can’t be all bad.

<br>


1. Roasted red pepper & sweet potato soup (directions below)

2. Rice noodles (brown or white) with poached cod (cook it in simmering water until it turns white), & either curry paste or pre made pesto. This is just as easy to make in a jar for a portable work-friendly meal. 

3. [Chili](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/secret-ingredient-chili) - eating it for as long as I reasonably can until it gets too warm to eat!

**What about you, what are your "cheat meals?" The ones that you go to when you just don't have time to cook?**
