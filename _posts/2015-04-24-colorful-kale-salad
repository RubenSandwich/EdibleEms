I got asked the other day about how to use raw kale in a salad without it tasting bitter, which inspired me to write down this recipe.
<br>

<div style="color: blue;">Kale is definitely one of the most trendy greens right now, and all the recipes I see using it are either kale chips or recipes using a lot of cheese to mask the taste!</div>
<br>

I love **kale chips** and **cheesy casseroles**, and there is nothing wrong with using kale this way *(except maybe the excessive cheese – gas anyone?!)*, but occasionally you need something a little more… sophisticated. This is a recipe for a more “grown up” way to eat kale.

	Nutrition Bonus Fact:

One thing to be aware of with kale and other cruciferous vegetables (collard greens, cabbage, brussel sprouts, etc) is their goitrogenic effect. **Goitrogens** can have an effect on the thyroid, especially if eaten in large amounts. They tend to slow the thyroid down, and can contribute to hypothyroidism. They literally make your thyroid gland larger! If you have an existing thyroid condition, it is best to cook these types of vegetables before eating them. This reduces the goitrogenic effects and makes them perfectly safe for most people, unless they have an extreme existing condition. <div style="color: blue;">For the average person, however, having a raw kale salad every once in a while will not be harmful and the benefits of kale far outweigh the negatives!</div>

**Kale Salad**

*Serves 4*

	Directions:


1.	Chop up kale into roughly bite-sized pieces. If you don’t like the stems, feel free to pull the leaves off first and just use the leaves in your salad. The stems can be composted and no waste is created. ☺


2.	Place the kale in a large bowl and add the juice from the ½ lemon, as well as the olive oil, salt & pepper. Begin to “massage” the kale, which is basically like kneading. Just work the kale with your hands for about three minutes. It will begin to soften as you do this. (See below for tutorial)

3.	Leave the kale for another three minutes or so. This will allow it to further soften while you finish the rest of dinner. 

4.	Taste the kale and add salt, pepper, olive oil, or anything else if it needs. Then stir in any of your desired toppings and enjoy!
