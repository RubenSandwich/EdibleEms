Tomorrow it is supposed to be 11 degrees. A **high** of 11 degrees, that is. I think it is time for comfort food, everybody!

	Ingredients:

* 1 sweet potato

* 1 carrot

* 1 can baby clams

* 1 shallot

* 1 T butter, coconut oil, or lard

* 2 tsp [tapioca flour](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WLHOY2?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B000WLHOY2&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) (white flour will work too if you can tolerate it, although it is not as good for you)

* 1 to 1.5 cup broth or water (depending on how thick you like your soup)
 
* 2 T [coconut milk](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTJ2BQ?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B001HTJ2BQ&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20), or other milk of your choice (for creaminess, can be omitted altogether)

* Salt & lots of pepper to taste

<br>


	Directions:

1. Peel sweet potato and carrot and chop into bite-sized pieces. 

2. Drain the clam juice into a pot on the stove and add the sweet potato & carrot. Set the clams aside and add enough water to cover them. Bring water to a boil and let cook for approximately 10-12 minutes, or until both are fork tender.

3. In the meantime, chop the shallot and begin to cook in a pan under medium heat with the butter or other fat of your choice. After about 4 minutes, when the shallot is starting to soften, add the flour, stir, and cook for another 2 minutes or so. Turn off the heat and add to the pot on the stove when finished along with some salt and pepper.

4. Add the water or broth and clams to your soup mixture and bring to a light boil. Once the soup begins to boil, turn off the heat, add the milk, and stir to incorporate. Add salt & pepper to taste, if more is needed.

5. Ladle into two bowls and enjoy!

	Note:

This recipe also works the same with white potatoes, I just like to mix things up sometimes. Feel free to swap the sweet potatoes for another variety to try different types!
