Before starting the 21-Day Sugar Detox, I was eating my [Pumpkin Almond Butter](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/pumpkin-almond-butter) A LOT. I refuse to eat canned pumpkin if I can help it, so most of my pumpkin consumption happens in the time that it is actually in season. But now that I decided to do [the detox](http://21daysugardetox.com), I realized I couldn't have any Pumpkin Almond Butter! And that was just not ok with me. 

So, I tweaked the recipe a bit to make it detox friendly. Just because you're on the 21-Day Sugar Detox, doesn't mean you can't have a nice pumpkin treat/snack!

	Directions: 



1. Put all ingredients in a food processor and pulse until blended and creamy.

2. Serve with raw celery, green apple slices, green-tipped banana, or whatever else that is 21DSD friendly and would makes sense to serve almond or peanut butter on.
