This recipe is similar in taste to Caesar Salad, but it uses sardines instead of anchovies. They have a strong flavor, but they work very well with all of the other flavors in this dish. If you absolutely cannot stand sardines though, anchovies would work fine as well. 

One question I get quite often is: *“How can you get enough calcium if you do not eat dairy?”* 

**I like to eat sardines when I can because they are an excellent source of calcium, especially the bone-in sardines.**

*I really like the Trader Joe's brand, but if there is not a Trader Joe's near you or it is easier to order them, [this brand](http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Planet-Sardines-Virgin-Lightly/dp/B003H7YHUW?ie=UTF8&creativeASIN=B003H7YHUW&linkCode=w00&linkId=JG4NG7GXPS5ERW5W&ref_=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til&tag=edib0a-20) is also a great choice.*

It sounds a bit gross, but you can actually eat them straight out of the can and will hardly even notice. Their bones are so small that the most you might feel is a bit of a crunch. 

If you cannot handle the sardines plain, however, this is a great recipe because I use a food processor to grind them up and combine them with lemon, garlic, olive oil, and other flavors that really blend well together. Plus then you cannot feel the bones at all. ☺

As shown in the picture above, you cannot even see the sardines, they simply are in the sauce to impart their wonderful flavor.
