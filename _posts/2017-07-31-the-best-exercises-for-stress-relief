Ok I'll be up front here by saying that this list is completely subjective. Meaning it is just my opinion and experience on what exercises I've found the most helpful for reduing stress in my life. 

And only in the past few months or so that I've been regularly doing these.

And they actually aren't real "exercises," but are more like stretchy-exercise mixes. Let's call them **"movements"** instead then. 

So these favorite movements are subject to change as I do and as I go through different seasons of life, which can often be true for a lot of wellness practices.

So use what you can for this and if these don't help you, move on to something else. But maybe they can help, and if they only help 1 other person then great.


**First,** is this roll-your-back-on-a-exercise-ball move. I LOVE this and do it every night to stretch out my upper back a bit before bed. Sometimes my back even cracks a bit and you may find that yours does too - this is totally fine and natural. Only worry if it hurts, then I'd say go see a doctor or chiropractor.

**Third,** you have been missing out if you haven't tried these power squats. I learned these at my [CHEK Holistic Lifestyle Coaching conference](www.chekinstitute.com) (yep I'm a certified [Holistic Lifestyle Coach!](http://edibleem.com/i-am-a-health-coach-now)) and have been doing them ever since.
