Everybody knows that it is so difficult to eat healthy while traveling, but especially while flying. Unlike a car trip, you can only bring a very limited amount of food, no drinks, and then cannot easily make a trip to a healthy grocery store once you arrive. These three issues make for a difficult combination, but I have found that healthy eating can still be done while flying. 

*A warning: my tips are not how to stay PERFECTLY clean and healthy, but rather give you options for a more balanced trip. There may be other ways to stay on a strict diet, particularly for people with allergies, but I have only begun to dig into this subject and these are simply my suggestions for the best trips from my experience. I hope it is helpful!*

**Summary:**

1. Stay hydrated. Water or coconut water are both always great, and sometimes a (no sugar added!) green juice can be refreshing. 

2. Sushi is a great grab & go option.

3. Pre-made salads can be quick, easy, and relatively clean. Look for dressings like honey mustard, 

4. Bring what you can. Apples, granola bars, and jerky all travel well. 

5. Try to make a grocery store run as soon as you can once you arrive.
