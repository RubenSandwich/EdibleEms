I believe sage is a spectacular spice that is often forgotten and underappreciated. It has a bit of a unique flavor so it cannot simply be added to any dish, but it goes perfectly in in this recipe and makes for a much nicer presentation. This recipe also uses ground chicken. What I love about ground meat is that it is so versatile – see print in Italics for suggestions of how to make this recipe stretch for two meals.

This dish is incredibly simple and perfect for a weeknight dinner! 




*Ingredients:*

* 1/2 onion

* 1 clove garlic

* 1/2 lb ground turkey (opt. use 1 lb and have leftovers for a breakfast frittata the next day)

* 1 T olive oil, coconut oil, or butter 

* 4 portabella mushroom caps, stems removed

* ¼ cup tomato sauce

* Salt & pepper

* Fresh sage

<br>

*Directions:*

1.	Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, put a pan with 1 T fat of your choice onto medium heat, and chop the onion and garlic.

2.	Cook the onions in a sauté pan for 3-4 minutes or until translucent, then add the garlic for about 30 seconds or until you smell the garlic flavor. Add the turkey and stir until cooked through. 

3.	When the turkey has cooked, turn the heat to low and add the salt, pepper, and tomato sauce. An option to add a bit of the fresh sage chopped into small pieces for extra sage flavor. :) Cook for 2 or 3 more minutes on low so that the flavors can mix a bit.

4.	While the turkey is cooking, wash the mushrooms and grease a baking pan or dish. Remove the stems from the mushrooms. Set the mushrooms on the dish and fill with the turkey and tomato mixture once it is finished. If using 1lb of turkey, set aside approximately half of the mixture after the tomato sauce is cooked in and save as a breakfast hash for the following day(s).

5.	Bake for about 15-18 minutes, or until mushrooms are cooked through.

6.	Once the mushrooms are taken out of the oven, wait 3-4 minutes for them to cool a bit, then top with fresh sage and serve.


*Notes:*

* Pairs well with a green salad, yellow squash, or zucchini noodles

* Can also substitute chopped fresh tomatoes or tomato paste

* Ground chicken would also work in place of the turkey
