As you will see in this video, each of my mornings is mainly spent caring for my pets, but really it is more them caring for me. My morning routine is a perfect mix of relaxation, light exercise, and healthful habits that make a positive start to my day, every day.

Here are the activities that fill my mornings each day before work:

* Lay in bed for 1-2 minutes with a timer, breathing and petting my dog while slowly adjusting to wakefulness. VIDEO

* Brush my teeth w/baking soda. VIDEO 

* Change into comfortable walking clothes. 

* Feed Archimedes the cat (he won’t let me walk out of the door before giving him some wet food!)

* Fill up my water bottle. 

 *  I drink as much of it as my body tells me I need during my morning walk and then refill it again before I head off  to work.

* Head out on a walk with my dog (~20 minutes)

  * Lunges for first block in my street 
  
  * Listen to a motivating podcast while walking. 
  
* Make a fabulous breakfast. 

  * Typical meal includes 2 eggs, a bit of additional protein (usually a few bites of sausage or smoked salmon), sauerkraut (or sauteed greens if I have more time), and additional fat from coconut milk that I put in my rooibos tea, homemade turmeric milk, or mate. If not having a homemade tea latte, I will typically add ½ a sweet potato or other starchy carb to this meal. I don’t leave much time for breakfast in the morning due to wanting extra sleep (!!), so if I don’t have time to do this I try to have blended up beets watered down w/a bit of water and lemon juice to drink at work, which will tide me over until lunch.

* “Me time” continues while on the drive to work: I love to listen to an audiobook. Right now I’m enjoying William Faulkner’s *The Light in August.*
