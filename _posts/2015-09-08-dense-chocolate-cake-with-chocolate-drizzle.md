This weeks marks **one full year** of creating and sharing recipes on this site! Eat With Emily typically does not have a lot of dessert recipes, but I felt like this occasion calls for a celebration cake! I am not great at baking and developing dessert recipes as they are much more complicated than meals and savory dishes. This is kind of embarrassing, but I have been working on this recipe for months to get it just right! I am so excited and proud of how it turned out, and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do!

*I realize this cake requires several special ingredients that you may not be used to buying, so I have linked to the brands that I use and love. Most of them can be found at your local grocery store or Whole Foods too.*

<br>

	Cake Ingredients:

* 1/2 cup coconut oil or butter

* 3 oz [fair trade dark chocolate](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HHEBD4?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B004HHEBD4&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20)

* 1 T [coconut flour](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YF99GM?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B000YF99GM&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20)

* 1/2 cup [fair trade cocoa powder](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012BXTU4?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B0012BXTU4&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20)

* 1 pinch salt

* 1/2 tsp cinnamon

* 1/2 tsp baking soda

* 3 eggs

* 1/2 cup maple syrup

<br>

	Frosting Ingredients:

* 1 can coconut cream *(Trader Joe’s is a really great brand)*

*  ¼ cup honey

* 1 T cocoa powder

* Pinch salt

*Note: If you don’t have coconut flour, it can be omitted. The cake will just be denser and more brownie-like.* 

<br>

	Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees farenheight.

2. Melt chocolate & butter/coconut oil in medium saucepan over low heat. 

3. Meanwhile, combine dry ingredients. Sift coconut flour and baking soda in a sifter so that they will mix easier and not form clumps. 

4. Once fully melted, take chocolate and coconut oil/butter off the heat. Add the rest of the wet and the dry ingredients.

5. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.

6. Let cool in pan for about 15 minutes before cutting and serving. 

**While the cake is cooling, make the frosting!**

1. Take out the can of coconut cream, flip it over, and take the bottom lid off. The cream will have separated and sunk to the bottom, so you will want to be able to take it out easier. Spoon out the cream into a small bowl.

2. Add the honey, cocoa powder, and pinch of salt to the coconut cream and mix either with a whisk or a small hand mixer.

3. The frosting is done when it is the consistency you like it to be. As seen in the pictures, mine was more of a runny glaze but **you can get a fluffier frosting if you leave the can of coconut cream overnight in the fridge first.**
