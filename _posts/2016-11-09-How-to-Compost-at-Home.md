Just over a year ago, my husband and I came to Pittsburgh from Portland. In Portland we had taken the citywide compost for granted. Every week we would gather our kitchen scraps into a clean bucket and set it out on the curb to be taken away to make compost. We had no idea about composting besides the fact that we knew it was a good thing and also made our garbage smell non-existent.

After a few weeks in Pittsburgh with our garbage stinking of rotten food and trying to keep our kitchen mess down, we realized that we needed to start composting again. It took a long time (and lots of messes) before we finally figured out a good system. To spare you the same trouble if you choose to partake in the composting journey, we decided to write about what worked for us.

### Here are the steps:


#### 1\. the container

Everyplace online says to use buckets. Don’t do it - we tried (as you can see from the cover picture). Use a shallow but wide container, instead, like this:



[HDX 17 Gal Storage Tote](http://www.homedepot.com/p/HDX-17-Gal-Storage-Tote-in-Black-HDX17GONLINE-6/205808350)


This way the compost has more surface area to break down. The container we have is angled on one side and has a small flap on one side that makes emptying plates out directly into your compost so easy! (But we were unable to find this container again online, which is why we linked to the one above.)


Be sure to drill holes in every side of the container because without air flow your food will not turn into compost.

#### 2\. the brown stuff

First, put a bottom layer of dirt, fallen tree leaves, or ripped up scratch paper. Every time you add a handful of food scraps you want to compost, you need to add a handful of what is referred to as “brown stuff,” or paper/dirt. This is a great way to get rid of all your junk mail. The ratio that I have found to work is 1:1.


#### 3\. the green stuff

Then you can put in the stuff you want to compost, being sure to add leaves/dirt/paper along the way.

#### 4\. no red stuff


In case you haven’t heard already, meat won’t compost very well and also attracts animals. Feed any meat scraps to your dog instead.

#### 5\. STIR, STIR and STIR some more



You absolutely have to stir. Every week. It is not fun but it is the only way to get things going. Use a strong stick or a shovel - the stuff gets really hard to stir after a while.


#### 6\. wait  

It has taken me a year to get my first bit of actual compost. maybe this is due to cold winters in Pittsburgh and my lack of stirring. but still, there is a certain amount of time that it takes and you have to be ok with that.


#### 7\. you will likely get worms in your container  

This is a good thing and helps speed along the process.


#### 8\. then you have compost

It should look just like dirt, but slightly darker.
