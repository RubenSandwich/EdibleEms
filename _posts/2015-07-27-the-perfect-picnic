I honestly believe that it does not take much money or anything big to have a great day. For me, just **good food and good company** make my life great. I love doing simple things, like going to a park for a picnic, and I honestly feel like I have had some of the best times doing something simple compared to taking an exciting vacation or going out in the city.

One of my favorite meals to take picnic-ing (is that a word?) is this **traditional Romanian dish** (called a *"spread"*). It is a simple, everyday meal that many Romanian families share on a regular basis. They will set out several platters filled with sausage, cheese, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, and bread in the middle of a table, then dip everything in salt and/or mustard to serve. It is basically a **dissected sandwich.** Nobody has their own plate, but instead they all share the meal together. I love the casual and social implications of this way of eating.



This was also the inspiration for our **wedding rehearsal dinner** I do not have pictures, unfortunately, but trust me - it was great. There is nothing more social (I think) than sharing a meal together, and this serving style of sharing **finger foods** makes it even more intimate.

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**Romanian "Spread"**</span>	

Serves 4

	Ingredients:

* 4 links of sausage, any variety

* 2 cucumbers

* 4 medium tomatoes

* 1 small onion

* 1/2 cup olives

* Hard cheese, optional

* 1/8 cup salt

<br>

	Directions:

1. Chop the sausages and saut√© in a frying pan with olive oil (if not already pre-cooked) until cooked through. Set cooked sausages in a plate in the fridge to let cool before serving (they are eaten cold for this recipe).

2. Chop the cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, and cheese into bite-sized pieces and arrange on a platter or several plates.

3. Place the salt in a small but wide bowl. It seems like a lot of salt, but as it is used for dipping 

4. To enjoy: Using your fingers, grab a slice of anything, dip it in salt and/or mustard (or just have it plain), and eat it! Yes, you can even eat the onions raw - the salt dims their strong kick and makes everything taste amazing.

*Note: Most Romanian spreads also include bread, but I try to avoid it as I believe it is not the healthiest option. So, this recipe does not include it, but traditionally bread would also be served, as I included in the pictures above.*
