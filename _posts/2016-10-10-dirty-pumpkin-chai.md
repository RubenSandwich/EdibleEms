Sometimes, you just want a little taste of pumpkin spice and/or coffee but not all the caffeine. This recipe is a great compromise for those days.

**Dirty Pumpkin Chai (Dairy Free)**

*Serves 2*

	Ingredients:

* 1/4 cup almond or cocout milk

* 1 cup strongly brewed chai tea (loose leaf is best but bagged works too)

* 1 tsp pureed pumpkin

* 1 tablespoon espresso or strongly brewed coffee

* 1-2 tablespoons 100% pure maple syrup (more or less depending on your preference of sweetness)

* Cinnamon for topping, optional

	Directions:
    
 1. If your chai is not made, boil 1 1/4 cup water and steep black chai tea in it for 8-10 minutes. Meanwhile, make your espresso if it is not already made.
 
 2. Once your tea and coffee are ready, throw all ingredients but for the cinnamon into a blender and blend for about 60 seconds or until smooth. 
 
 3. Reheat if necessary.
 
 4. Top with cinnamon (optional), and enjoy!
