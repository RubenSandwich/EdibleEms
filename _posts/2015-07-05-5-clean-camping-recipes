<span style="font-size: 20px;">**4th of July Camping Trip Recap**</span>

<br>

Last weekend Ruben & I celebrated 4th of July with my parents over a camping trip in the Gorge. We went to **Viento State Park**, which was a beautiful campground right along the Columbia River. It was also, unfortunately, right along the railroad tracks. As much as I do recommend the site and the beautiful rocky river beach it sits on, I would also just warn of the potential to be woken up in the middle of the night by a passing train. Overall, it was a great location, easy to get to, and had great river access.

As for the **activities**, this was a pretty low-key trip. Just being in nature was so relaxing and made us feel like we did not have to go anywhere or do anything, but rather just sit and enjoy reading an actual book (rather than using a computer) on a lawn chair in the middle of the woods or going on a walk along the river shore.

The last full day we were there, we went on a short hike to see **Starvation Creek Falls.** The trailhead is near the day-use area of the campground and takes you along the old Columbia River Highway path. There are great overlooks without having to go up much elevation gain, and at the end is a gorgeous creek fed by a surprisingly tall waterfall. I highly suggest the walk if you are in the area.

<br>

	1. First Day Lunch

I really wanted to get as many fresh greens in while I could, so in the morning before we left I made a salad of:

* Mixed greens

* Proscuitto

* Olives

* Olive oil

The proscuitto already has salt so there was no need to add any. This salad, combined with other **no-cook side dishes** of mixed nuts and fruit, made for a healthy and satisfying meal.

	2. Broccoli Salad

My mom brought an amazing broccoli salad that lasted in our *cooler all weekend. I ate it with just about every meal. Just mix the following ingredients together, and then add olive oil just before serving!

* 1 head broccoli

* 4 slices bacon, chopped

* 1/2 cup craisins

* 1/4 cup sunflower seeds

* Olive oil for dressing (pack separately and drizzle on just before serving)

*<span style="font-size: 15px;">Our mini-cooler was a wedding present from our good friends and can be found [HERE](http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-FlipLid-qt-l-Cooler-Blue/dp/B000IBWI42/ref=wr_it_dp_o_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=2UI1YOKLA3JZ7&coliid=I1SW4NO1PQEL4J&psc=1). It is great for day trips and picnics especially, due to its small size. </span>

	3. Portable Snacks/Sides

I suggest bringing a few hearty vegetables that will endure the heat and travel. I always bring **carrot sticks**, and this trip I brought **avocados** that I chopped at the camp site as well as some of my **homemade sauerkraut** that I kept in the cooler along with the carrots.

*I love eating colorful food!*

	4. Grilled or Roasted Pineapple

When everyone's roasting their marshmallows, you can join right along with the festivities...**without a stomachache later.** 

Just chop up a fresh pineapple and skewer it onto the same stick that you would normally use for marshmallows, and hold it over the fire until the pineapple gets warm, a little bit black on the edges, and oozing with naturally sugary juice.

<br>

	5. Dessert

Dessert is a simple equation: 

*Dark chocolate + almond butter = no cook camping dessert*

It does not look super impressive, but it is rich and nourishing at the same time.

*Note: We got our compostable plates shown in the pictures above and the utensils shown below at **Earth Centric**, a local environmentally-conscious store in Portland, OR. The store has unfortunately shut down since we were there, but similar compostable plates and silverware can be found to order in bulk [HERE](http://www.ecoproducts.com/products.html). I love using our compostable plates for traveling so I do not have to feel bad about creating plastic waste.*
