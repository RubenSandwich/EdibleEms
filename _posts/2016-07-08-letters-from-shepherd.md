*Part 2 of The Story of Ruben and Emily (find Part 1 [here](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/ruben-emily-1))*

<br>

I saw him out of the corner of my eye just as he was about to approach the shed where I was managing mini-golf. It was the second week into camp and I was feeling totally overwhelmed, so this was in part welcome but also terribly stressful. 

Welcome because over the past three weeks I had started to realize that this man was somebody who I was definitely interested in getting to know a bit more. Stressful because I knew each interaction I had was extremely limited in time.

We ended up sitting in a circle with us two and three or so other children. (Romantic, huh?) He again surprised me in his knowledge as he answered these kids surprisingly deep questions about life and God. He has this unique way of keeping the conversation light while meaningful and I was so entranced! 

Another part of camp that I haven’t mentioned yet is the letters. Since camp staff were not allowed to use technology, everybody would write fun notes to each other and stick them in their staff mailboxes. Shepherd and I got caught up in this tradition, but instead of fading out halfway through the summer or just writing jokes back and forth, the letters slowly became longer and longer. By the end of the summer they were 5 pages, handwritten, going in depth about our family stories and background! 

This was a great way to get to know each other but still kept us intrigued to know more. By the end of July, I was DYING to get some alone time to talk to this guy! For some reason, every weekend we missed each other or were in such large groups that we couldn’t talk. This was incredibly frustrating and made me wonder if he even wanted to get to know me too, as I did not seem to see any effort on his part to seek me out.

*Going rollerblading as a group was about as close to a date as I got that summer!*

<br>

After two and a half months of constant letter writing back and forth, though, I was pretty sure this relationship would keep progressing. But of course was still completely doubtful that this amazing man would be interested in me! This doubt kept me from believing anything would go further until…. He asked me to go to the staff banquet with him!
