I wish I could tell you that the first months of our relationship was bliss. That tends to be how most people's’ relationships go (or so it seems from reading other blogs and talking to people), although it is difficult to know if this is reality or just a pretty picture that people like to paint.

Our relationship was difficult not due to the fact that we were having trouble getting along, no not at all, but rather it was because of extremely difficult circumstances, huge life changes, and gaps in life stages.

<br>

**Difficult Circumstances**

Being apart is not good for any relationship, especially in the beginning. I applaud people who are able to foster their friendships or any type of relationship over a distance. With Ruben and I, it was not so much of a physical distance as we were living in the city, but it was a matter of time and transportation.

I had a pretty rough time in engineering school and had to spend more time than anyone in my class (it seemed) studying just to keep up. Ruben worked crazy hours (more on that below) and neither of us had cars! Without cars, it would take over an hour on the bus to visit each other, which meant spending an entire day together when we did visit, which was only occasional during the first 2 years of dating.

Ruben losing his job was another huge difficulty we faced together within 3 months of starting to date. He was taking a year off school as he realized his private school he had been attending did not have any major which he wanted to pursue. So, Ruben went on to spend a rough year of job hunting, working various odd jobs (including night shift at a machining factory!), and getting laid off several times.

When this school year was almost at a close, Ruben decided to return back to school with a new purpose: to pursue a degree in computer science. It made so much sense as Ruben had always loved technology, building, using his mind, and solving problems. I never would have thought of this as an option, but I am so glad he was able to discern something that he would love and that could give him either a traditional job or a way to do contract work, both of which he has done since then.

This decision gave us more clarity in our relationship and took away the stress of the unknown. While it took away many of our problems, it also led to another difficult of less time for each other and an intense 3.5 years of schooling ahead of us. This initial decision and realization of how spending the next 3.5 years in school would affect our relationship long-term put a huge stress on us at a very early stage.

<br>

**Huge Life Changes**

I had a straight path (at the time, but now I’m all confused again - more on that another day!) in terms of my career. Still, even just the college stage is a time of change and uncertainty, not knowing in what city of where I would end up afterward, or even whether or not I would get a job or go to grad school or do a year of service first!

Ruben was in the midst of figuring out his career and also had much school ahead of him when he finally decided to study computer science. I was mid-schooling while he was just starting school. This is a lot different than most people who either meet during school or afterward while both working.

<br>

**Different Life Stages**

All of this, combined with our age difference (only 2 years but it made a difference in this case) and Ruben’s friends’ being older made it hard on some levels to connect. We knew we were so similar and held the same values (and even liked going to the same coffee shops!), but these differences had to be worked through and worked out through lots of conversations and reflection.

<br>

**All Worth it in the End**

All of this was difficult in the season in which we ceased to be a carefree new couple and began our journey toward serious partnership. Frankly I’m glad that we encountered these obstacles right away: it helped us grow closer much more quickly, it showed us each others’ true character as we saw each other in difficult circumstances and witnessed each others’ reactions to these events, and it forced us to learn how to work together.
