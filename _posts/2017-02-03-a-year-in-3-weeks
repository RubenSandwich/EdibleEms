**The wedding was 3 weeks away.**

![.jpg](/content/.jpg)

Thursday, May 1st, 2014. I had just taken my last final of my undergraduate career and suddenly everything slowed down and there was only the wedding in my mind. The next 3 weeks were preparations, final planning, and trying to get calm after all of the drama of the past 6 months. I thought it would be time but I learned later that I needed so, so much more. But, life is life and I needed to start work and pay bills, unfortunately. Once I began working I’d have 6 months before I could take even 1 day of vacation (I know, state jobs aren’t all that easy) so it was time to get married now or wait another 6 months. I was ready to get it done, but time crept by so slowly these three weeks that it just felt like a whole year between school ending and the actual wedding day.

**But what about my graduation?**

In between all of this wedding/family drama/craziness I happened to graduate from college!! No big deal…

No, to me, it really was a big deal. Maybe to some it is just another small accomplishment but my education did not come easy to me and I was so grateful that I was able to graduate with a degree that I enjoyed and have so many more opportunities come to me because of it.

**I cancelled my own bachelorette weekend.**

One of my regrets of this season was my rash decision to cancel our bachelorette getaway weekend. I had planned an overnight at a bed and breakfast outside of Portland in Forest Park. Two out of three of my bridesmaids had even made plans to travel down 3 hours away from Seattle for the weekend trip, just 2 weeks before the wedding, when they would have to do the trip all over again. Literally the day they were traveling to my house I decided to cancel our reservation (the bed and breakfast allowed it, crazy enough) and just have them sleep on the couch in my apartment. Totally crazy and weird, but that was just one of the ways I was freaking out about the wedding. Sure, our saved money was running out and I wouldn’t even begin working until a week after the wedding, but still, it would have been totally fine to spend a bit for the memories. I still cannot believe that’s what I decided to do.

Luckily though, my friends were such great sports and were totally understanding of my freak out. They instead stayed at my apartment and we took long walks and made dinner together and chatted and it ended up being a really fun, relaxing weekend for me. I am so grateful for my friends and for their ability to have so much fun just being together rather than having to do something elaborate. All ended well and I was finally able to take my mind off my nervousness of having two weddings, at least for the weekend.
