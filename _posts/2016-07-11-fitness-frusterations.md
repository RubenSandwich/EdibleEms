This site is usually a place of cheer and only contains happy posts, but honestly nobody can be happy all of the time. I feel like it would be fake to not talk about the frustrations I am having in the gym lately, particularly with my [#splitschallenge](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/splits-challenge). 

I feel so hypocritical after saying that I did not care if it took me a year to get this, but after just 3 months I am already hitting a **plateau** and am having a hard time not being negative about it.

**But am I totally out of place?** I mean, after 3 months of working towards something every single day, you'd expect to see progress right? Especially considering I have only skipped a handful of days when out backpacking (when I do lunges and other stretches) or on a very rare occasion when I am to tired. To give an idea of how hard I have been working at this, check out my schedule below.

<br>

**Here is my current routine:**

* 20 seconds each leg

* 20 seconds middle splits, going into open leg stretch from there

* End with butterfly and back stretches

* Repeat nightly (about 5x per week)

<br>

**Don't bash on the 20 second hold. 20 seconds is a long time when you're holding in a splits position!**

<br>

Since starting this post and taking these pictures, though, I have tried to get all the way into the splits a few times and here is what I've found:

* I can get way further after I've exercised, any type of exercise. These pictures were all taken when I was pretty much cold, so I do take some comfort in that.

* The longer I stretch, the further I seem to be able to go. Maybe it's time to up my game and increase my stretch time?

<br>

Either way, I know I've got to keep trying and that 3 months in the span of my lifetime of not stretching enough is nothing. The only thing that matters is that I continue to get healthier, and doing the splits will not necessarily increase the span of my life. Though it would be fun to do someday. :)

*Maybe doing the splits won't make me happy, but smiling will!*
