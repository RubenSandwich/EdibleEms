This is a new subject that I am getting increasingly excited about, and I know that lots of people have been curious and asking questions about my backpacking trips, and in particular the food I bring (for obvious reasons). 

I stripped down my knowledge to just the basic, fundamental items and planning that needs to go into a backpacking trip. It’s really not as hard as you would think, and is so much more rewarding and enjoyable than car camping.

**Location, Location, Location**

Depending on where you live, it can be more or less difficult to find a great spot. Every single time I have gone, I have gone to a place where a friend or acquaintance has personally told me that they have been to and enjoyed. There is only so much information you can find online, so asking people who have been is the only way to ensure a great visit.

Additionally, make sure your location has plenty of water sources! This is something you have to be super intentional about since you likely will not be in a regular campground site. Most official backpacking trails do have plenty of water, but it cannot hurt to check yourself.

**Distance**

My advice for distance to backpack is definitely not going to be a one size fits all number. I am honestly still figuring out this myself, but a general rule is this: only go about ½-¾ of the distance you would normally go on a day hike. So, I seem to enjoy hikes around 10 miles for the day (not too challenging but still getting my gas money’s worth), so for backpacking, I can only go 5-7 miles in one day maximum. Maybe as I get more experienced (and learn to pack a little better), I will improve, but to start out I would definitely not go more than 7 miles in one day. 

If I do a 7 mile on the first day, then usually the second day is lighter, more around 3 miles. You’d be surprised how tired you get by hiking, carrying a lot of weight, and then sleeping on the ground!

Besides, the point of backpacking is not to be the most intense outdoorsman/woman you can be… It is about being in nature, moving, resting from your usual life, and having fun! How can you enjoy the scenery when you are trudging through just trying to get 12 miles in?

**Carry Ons**

As far as the stuff you need to bring, these are the must-haves, if nothing, that you need to survive out in the woods away from the camping sites.

<br>

1.) Water filter

This is super obvious, but you cannot forget this! The brand you get matters a lot, too, as there are many expensive tools, pills, etc. that maybe work ok, but leave the water tasting...like river-stones…

I love my [Camelbak](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YX7WK4K?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B00YX7WK4K) and it is definitely the most highly recommended from all of my other backpacking buddies.

<br>

2.) Pots and pans

Carry around cooking pots and pans while backpacking sounds crazy, but there are actually specially made products just for backpacking. That are relatively cheap, surprisingly light, and allow for other stuff to fit inside! The [ones I use](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FQZEYWE?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B00FQZEYWE) are super durable and have lasted for years.

3.) Portable stove

A [portable stove](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U8CP88?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B004U8CP88) like this one is IMPERATIVE when backpacking. Trust me, after 1 day of eating raw food you will want some comfort food. Don't forget that at elevation it gets pretty cold at night, too, and it is super nice to be able to have warm food and/or hot chocolate! 

<br>

4.) Propane to go with stove

We order [this brand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVJ4M?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B001GCVJ4M) and it lasts for several 1-2 day trips.

<br>

5.) Lighter

This is actually not mandatory, but it helps start fires a lot quicker and helps in case of fire failures. :) I have no specific brand, just any small lighter will do. 

<br>

6.) Small tent or tarp


“Real backpackers” (in my mind, those who do the PCT or go for 1 week + at a time) only use a tarp, but I am not that hard core. I like to feel like I am sleeping "inside" so to speak.

*Even though they brake down to be extremely tiny, these two person tents are surprisingly roomy once set up.*

<br>

7.) Small sleeping bag

This may not work for those of you at extreme elevations during the spring or late fall, but I have been quite comfortable in my ["Eoopro"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SKDU554?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B00SKDU554) sleeping back during the summer, although if I were to backpack at very high elevations or early spring/late fall, I would find something more heavy duty.

8.) Backpack - doesn’t have to be fancy! Mine definitely isn't, although Ruben's is a step up and I will show you both. To begin with, I would say it doesn't matter much, but as you get more and more serious you would probably need to buy a special backpack. I haven't gotten to that level yet, but I will let you know when I do. :)

I got [my backpack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HU0DKEG?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B00HU0DKEG) a few years ago and it is super lightweight and flexible. It doesn't have a hard back on it so I can fill it up more, and add any shapes that I want to. I highly suggest it, although it is not great for carrying papers because it is so flimsy! Definitely more of a sports bag.

Ruben’s is from a small store in Portland, but we found a similar backpack [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SYFN0QE?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B00SYFN0QE), which he will likely order once his breaks.

**Food Ideas (other than trail mix)**

I get so tired of eating nuts while backpacking. Although some of my suggestions will include nuts and trail mixes, there are a lot of other foods you can take just as easily.

1.) Hot chocolate mix! 

You cannot go camping without hot chocolate! It’s not hard to make your own mix and it well worth the extra centimeter of space to pack it. Last time I even brought a small [can of coconut milk], which I felt was also worth the space and weight. But, to each his own!

2.) Chili

Simply defrost the meat as you hike, then cook the rice and beans there, bring spices, and tomato paste if you have room. Easy peasy and SO filling after a long day of hiking! (see picture above with pots and pans for my chili from the last trip - recipe coming soon!)

3.) Smoked salmon  

Once you open it you need to finish within a day or so, but it will keep unopened for several days so it is a perfect protein for days 2 or 3.

4.) Avocados

Also last for several days outside of the fridge, although once you open one, you better eat it or it’ll get bad real quick...

5.) Bell peppers

Only last about 1 day, but it feels really great to get as many veggies in while you can!
