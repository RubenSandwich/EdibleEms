The dreary Tuesday morning was strangely not affecting me today - I was on winter break and getting ready to hang out with my boyfriend all week long! Some of the biggest pain of college were the intense exam periods right before breaks, which led to some of the biggest benefits of college: long, total breaks with absolutely no work to do or even think about! As I drove toward Ruben’s house I remember singing in the car and finally feeling like I could relax after a long semester. 


I parked by Ruben’s house, almost an hour early, and walked down the hill to the coffee shop were going to meet at. Once Ruben came, I put my book down and expected a nice coffee date. But, he kept playing with his phone and took 2 long bathroom breaks leaving me to wait by myself. Not romantic. 


I pushed my feelings aside though and felt better as we were walking back towards his house. Ruben seemed annoyed that I parked so far, probably because it was cold I thought. The plan was to spend the day together having coffee and then a nice homemade lunch at Ruben’s house. Ruben had plans for the evening with a friend. After a rather rushed-feeling lunch, Ruben suggested we drive up to Mt Tabor park, our favorite place in the city, which is an extinct volcano within the city limits of Portland. It’s also stunningly beautiful with incredible views of Portland and the surrounding area. 


We parked near the top and walked to the meadow, which has volcanic rock on one wall and was surrounded by huge evergreen trees on all side. When I rounded the corner I saw it and immediately knew. Behind a stone wall was a life-size plyboard replica of Sunflower, the boat Ruben took me on [our first date](http://edibleem.com/sunflower). Ruben sarcastically stated “Oh, what is this doing here?” and then kneeled behind it. 


I don’t remember what he said at all, I was suddenly so nervous. He took out a ring and I could barely focus and see it. I hurriedly said yes and hugged him like we never had before. Abruptly Ruben called out for Stephen, and then I realized that our friend had been hiding to take pictures of us. Funnily enough, he didn’t get any due to being worried that I would see him, so all of our photos were faked!

I soon found out all the playing on the phone and long bathroom breaks were Ruben trying to tell Stephen we would be late. Of course his phone died this morning so Ruben couldn’t get ahold of him!


Ruben did not actually have evening plans (except celebrating with me!), so we spent the afternoon running around, celebrating an impromptu dinner at a sushi bar, and calling friends and family. The timing was perfect, allowing for a week of engagement-bliss and ending with a special Christmas celebration with my family - Ruben had already planned on spending Christmas with my family and we had an even more memorable time being able to celebrate our engagement with my family in person.
