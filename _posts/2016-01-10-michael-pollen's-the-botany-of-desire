As my interest in food, health, and nutrition has grown, it has been almost necessary to find reading material to keep up with my voracious appetite. This is the first in a series I will call **Read With Emily,** for which I have no particular schedule but will be filling you all in with my current food and nutrition reads.

I recently finished one of Michael Pollen's lesser known books called [The Botany of Desire](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375760393?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0375760393&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20). It was a fascinating read of the history of food as it relates to our senses. Throughout history humankind has had prevalent desires that have not seemed to change. The book breaks our major desires into four categories:

**Sweetness** is represented by the apple.

**Beauty** is signified in a tulip.

**Intoxication** exampled in marijuana. 

**Control** shown through the way farmers grow potatoes.

Here's a quick breakdown of each of the sections for those who think they might be interested in reading the book.

A. Apples

Pollen's description of man's desire for sweetness follows the story of apples in U.S. I never knew they originally were not native to the U.S., but instead are thought to have come from Kazakhstan and spread from there.

Did you also know that apples were initially used to make cider and rarely used to eat? Apparently this was due to lack of grapes in Eastern U.S., so cider was common instead of wine. This and many other facts captured my attention throughout this section. It is amazing how something as common as the apple has such a rich history!

*Some peaches we picked at a farm last summer. Humans in general have always been drawn to fruit, as they are high energy food sources.*

B. Tulips

Flower in general are considered symbols of beauty in every culture. Pollen focuses on tulips as they have been modified throughout history in order to conform to each culture and time's idea of beauty (something I had no idea had been happening prior to reading this book). 

In addition to the intriguing history of **the evolution of tulips**, Pollen also speculates about the reasons why we enjoy beauty. In nature and in history beautiful things have often been good or helpful things, which may be why humans have been subconsciously drawn to them. This is not necessarily true, however. For instance, what benefit do tulips give? Yet humans have continually planted and replanted them through the years. They must be replanted year after year or else they will not regrow. 

Here is a quote I absolutely love:

	"...beauty in nature does not necessarily bespeak health, not necessarily redound to the benefit of the beautiful." 

This is so, so applicable to human health, and is something that has been on my mind for a while now. This quote was not in the context of health as much, but it reminds me of how **we humans often equate beauty with health.** 

For example, **the idea that women who are thin and beautiful are healthy** could not be further from the truth. A very small percentage of the population is naturally thin, and for the rest of the population, being thin is not helpful. If a woman is too thin, she often loses her fertility, which is in no way an indicator of health! Anyway, I could talk about this subject until the cows come home, but I will save it for **a future blog post.**

C. Marijuana

Pollen gives great insight into *how and why* humans have always found a way to temporarily alter their state of mind, no matter what culture or timeframe. Even children, he points out, love sucking helium out of balloons or spinning around in circles until they are dizzy. This section was mainly obvious, at least the main point of it was, but the history he tracks is actually pretty interesting.

*Don't worry, these are just regular brownies. :)*

<br>

D. Potatoes

This was by far the most interesting section for me. Pollen gives a short history of how genetic engineering came to be a common practice, specifically with growing potatoes, as they are a commonly genetically engineered crop. Pollen then discussed the **implications of genetic engineering** and what it says about humans' proclivity to try and control things. All of this was discussed with an honorably **balanced approach**, considering all of the controversy surrounding this issue.

*One fact everybody knows about potatoes: with enough oil they make excellent home fries!*

<br>

**Summary**

This book was filled with Pollen's thoughts and speculations, and I loved it. It was like a glimpse into his mind and it make me think about things I would not usually think about. Things I take for granted, especially the food I eat, have a rich history and it is worth thinking about where these things comes from! I highly suggest you read [The Botany of Desire](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375760393?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0375760393&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20)!
