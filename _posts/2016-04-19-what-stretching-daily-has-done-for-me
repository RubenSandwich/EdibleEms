When I started a challenge to be able to do the splits, I never thought that the 45 seconds a day I spent stretching would affect so much of my life. Here are some of the ways stretching consistently each day has improved my health so far.

1.) Improved sleep!

Perhaps this is because I tend to stretch right before bedtime. It helps to calm me down more than anything else. I have always had a difficult time falling asleep, so this surprising benefit has been particularly rewarding to me.

2.) Increased athletic performance

I guess this sounds obvious, but I truly did not think about how it would help everything Iâ€™ve tried to do. Of course it helps with running, which I do several times a week, but it even has helped me with [kettlebell training](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/new-fitness-classes), particularly squatting movements and the like. Definitely worth the few minutes a day for this benefit alone!

3.) Decreased stress

Just those few minutes of stretching has infiltrated my whole day, starting with a refreshing night's sleep and even throughout the day. I use little moments when waiting for tea to boil or something else and it keeps my mind off negative thoughts, helps the time go by faster, and resets my mindset.

*Right leg forward - definitely looks so awkward! I'm going to be working on the posture for this side in the following week.*
