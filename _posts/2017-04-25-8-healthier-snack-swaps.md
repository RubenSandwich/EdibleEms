**To Snack Or Not To Snack**


No matter whether you decide to snack or not, always have full meals first. Incorporate [healthy fats](http://edibleem.com/eating-fat-is-healthy!), [natural sources of carbohydrates](http://balancedbites.com/paleo-diet-carbs/), and [clean proteins]http://balancedbites.com/content/protein-basics/) with every meal, at least 2-3 times per day. 

<br>

**If You Don’t Snack**


Be sure you are getting enough nourishment from your meals. Have at least 3 square meals each with protein, carbohydrates, and fat. If any of your meals are compromised, then stop snacking and go back to having 3 meals. Only snack if you cannot make it between meals first.

**If You Do Snack**


Focus on real foods, proteins, and healthy fats. Stay away from carbs on their own. Here are a few of my go-to snacks:


1. Nuts & seeds (or if you really want a treat, some nut butter with a square of dark chocolate!)


2. Clean granola bars (Larabars/Rx Bars, etc.)


3. Pre-cut veggies (Carrots, bell peppers, celery, etc.)


4. Fresh fruit (no need to pre-chop!)


5. Smoked oysters (great source of zinc)


6. Epic bars (think of a combination of granola bars and jerky...sounds gross but don’t knock it until you try it!)


7. Plantain chips (Trader Joe’s has good options)

8. Olives
