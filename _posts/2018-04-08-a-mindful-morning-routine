A morning routine that incorporates mindfulness seems daunting. Most people don't even have a morning routine to speak of, let alone trying to be mindful while also scrambling to get out the door.

But you really can change your mindset in the morning fairly effortlessly....

Here are some practices I incorporate into my morning routine to easily....

* Take a short walk before eating breakfast.

* Make a fabulous breakfast. This helps me appreciate...

* Focused mindfulness time does not need to stop when you leave the house! Try listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or music in the car or on the bus that will continue to bend your mind toward awareness.

The most effective morning routine is a mix of relaxation, light exercise, and healthful habits that make a positive start to your day, every day.
