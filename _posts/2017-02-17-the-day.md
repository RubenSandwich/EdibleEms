**Our Wedding Day Story**

<br>


**The Day Starts in the Evening**


The tone for the day often times starts from the evening before, and my wedding day was no different. To be completely honest, the whole thing was a tad bittersweet. I know your wedding day is supposed to be nothing but pure joy, and ours included a lot of joy for sure, but the tone was generally very serious. 


I’ll explain that in a sec.

Back to the evening before: we had a wonderful rehearsal and picnic afterward in the park with the wedding party and some of my immediate family. But something happened beforehand that pushed my nervousness back into the forefront of my mind and made the evening before the wedding completely rushed.
The day beforehand, R’s mother requested that we drive to their church (a 30-40 minute drive from my apartment) on the day before our wedding, a Friday night, to say thank you to all the people who were setting up (during rush hour/dinnertime). It makes sense as a formality and to be nice, but it was so last minute when all my family was arriving that day and I was already having trouble calming down about all the last-minute wedding details (which always happen no matter how well you plan).


But we agreed (my mom convinced me actually, I had previously told R no!) and R, my mom and I drove to the church while my dad helped the other guests, my family. I left my family to do this one last formality besides the wedding and I hoped that it would help appease the parents. After saying “thank you” to everyone setting up, getting a detailed tour of the church, and hearing last minute explanations of all that was expected from us during the Romanian ceremony, we rushed out and to the park for our rehearsal. 


My family and friends were so wonderful at the rehearsal and R of course was worth any of the stress I felt. I left the picnic happy and thankful and was able to mostly ignore any feelings of nervousness about having two weddings in the same day. 


When we got home, my wonderful friend Julie surprised me with a thoughtful wedding gift. A funny feel-good book with a heartfelt message handwritten inside wrapped inside a beautiful new bag made me feel so loved. When I think back on it, I felt so overwhelmed with everything that I probably didn’t show Julie (and many others) the gratitude I felt for their support throughout the whole time. 

I went to bed happy, but having an incredibly tough time falling asleep, tossing and turning, just hoping that the timeline would work and that I wouldn’t miss my own wedding due to any hiccups with the Romanian one.

**Not for the bride!**


I woke up with a start as my phone alarm rang at 5:50am and immediately started hurrying around my apartment, taking a shower, fixing eggs for myself and Julie (I always make time for breakfast!), and packing my bag and of course the wedding cake. Julie drove me to our hair appointment, where I got completely snubbed by my hairdresser who I think was mad because I must have forgotten to tip at our practice appointment. She kept saying things about tipping for beauty appointments and how you’re supposed to tip at least 20% and telling me stories about not tipping. Ok ok I get it, I’m sorry lady! I don’t get my hair done that often so I don’t even think about it. 


The strangest moment was when she loudly announced “I’m going to get coffee for us!” to which I said “Oh, thank you!” and she looked at me like I was crazy, and said “It’s not for YOU, it’s for me and my assistant!” Which was fine because I don’t even drink coffee usually, but the snobbery was super weird. I thought everyone was supposed to be nice to you and happy for you on your wedding day?


I guess not. 


Well, I tipped double that day, left, and hoped that the rest of her day went a little bit better.

**The (second best) part of the day**


I’ve NEVER liked getting photos done, but I was especially dreading getting wedding photos done. I really really wanted nice photos, but I hate posing and I told our photographer friends (Jay and Debbie) that I would do 30 minutes and that was all. Luckily for me they ignored that, showed up at least 40 minutes early, and we had a great time taking family and bridal party pictures. 


Our friends were AMAZING, made me laugh so much and the banter between R and Jay was hilarious. I had so much fun and hardly realized I was getting my picture taken. Plus, the pictures turned out pretty great, don’t you think?!

**The first ceremony**


After the pictures we all booked it to the church for the first ceremony. The music played seamlessly and my dad walked me down wonderfully. Nobody was smiling, not even R’s family, until I got toward the front, looked to my right and saw my whole family and some close friends beaming at me. My sister Anna’s face in particular caught my eye and reassured me so much. I have never felt so wonderful and so horrible at the same time.

I went straight from my father’s grip to R’s, where he crossed behind me (some Romanian/Pentecostal tradition) so that I was on his right side. They asked me to kneel with my back to the audience, but I had to do so without lifting my dress which was crazy hard. I tripped on it a bit while standing up but once I got straightened out all I had to do was make it to the “thrones” as we called them and sit down. The service was longer than any other wedding I had ever been to (and longer than most of my church’s services, even). Most of it was in Romanian, but the parts that were not were all pretty general “Christianese” statement and feel-good Bible verses taken out of context. Just like a lot of weddings, I guess.


At the end of it they had us kneel while R’s dad and some of the church leaders encircled us, gripping our shoulders and praying loud and intensely in Romanian. It was so scary to me. I felt like they were upset, like something was wrong. I know that they take marriage and everything seriously, but it honestly seemed like they were more nervous about this than anything. Was it because I was an “American?” Was it because I am not part of their church? I don’t know what they said in those prayers and never will, but I will certainly never forget how it felt. 

With that, we were “married” in the Romanian church (although not technically married because we had not signed papers with that pastor) and R’s family was as happy as they could be. We walked down the aisle and I went straight outside to get a break and some fresh air. I was immediately pulled back inside and required to stand there and greet every last person leaving the service. The hardest part was over, now we just had to make sure we made it in time to our real wedding.

**Happy moments**

There were several moments of this “meet-and-greet” time which took me completely off guard. 


First, was Irene. My friend had been so supportive and understanding of my difficulties with family and had done all she can to take me dress (material) shopping just the two of us, then she came to our entire Romanian wedding AND our real wedding. I just could not believe that she took the time to support us the whole day after all she had done with making my dress and cheering me up along the way. When she came to say hi I just didn’t know what to say. I was so appreciative for her friendship and understanding. 

Second was my brother, Jesse, whom I see a lot of in R actually (if that isn’t weird to say!). As soon as he came up to me, tears started welling up in his eyes and once I saw that I couldn’t help but to cry, even more than he was. There was nothing really to say, but that our lives were changed and we both now had our own families. I can’t say that it is a completely sad thing, but it just meant that our relationship changed in a big and sudden way. 

<br>

**Reception #1**


The tradition at this church was to place the bridal party on a stage where we had to sit and eat in front of everyone. After food, R and I tried to go greet everyone but after an hour and a half (yep!!) we still hadn’t said hi to everyone. 


A kid walked around with this large bird house speaking in Romanian, which I later learned was there to collect money for the new couple. We later had to give this back to the parents in order to “pay them back” for the wedding, which I learned is part of the tradition. Romanian weddings are basically a huge exchange of money between the entire community, so nobody really makes or loses money. It’s an interesting tradition that I didn’t completely understand, but I tried my very best to be part of this and to show that I honored their traditions. I never got much of a response from the family, but I hope they know that I did this for them, trying my best to give them honor in a culture that mostly ignores them.

**Waiting for family**


The part where I was most apprehensive about was the transition between the reception before our real wedding ceremony. I had so much anxiety about missing our wedding, especially since R’s parents were not happy about us having the park wedding. We were able to leave the church with absolutely no problems, which I couldn’t be more thrilled with. Once we got to Mt Tabor and settled down, though, we realized R’s parents were still not even on their way. We waited and R called over and over again. Finally he got ahold of them and they seemed overly stressed out. We were confused because most of the congregation had left at the same time we did. R’s mom said something about dropping the cake on the floor but that they were in fact coming. We anxiously waited another half an hour, by now 40 minutes past our ceremony’s starting time. All of our guests were waiting for more than 40 minutes for us, but everyone was gracious and nobody said a word to us about it, even later. They finally made it and we lined up, thankful that our whole families were there and that we could now begin the celebration that we had been so looking forward to.

**Finally, married**


I could write an entire other post on our ceremony alone. Most people say they remember nothing of their wedding ceremony but for some reason I remember so many details of mine. I remember exactly how it felt walking down the aisle and seeing everyone beam up at me. I remember the slightly awkward exchange between my parents, R’s parents, and myself and R. I remember our officiant’s talk, and how he incorporated so many personal stories, humor, and genuine marriage advice rather than feel-good quotes. I remember Ruben’s vows, taking communion as our first act as a married couple, then doing a quick kiss and walking back down the aisle, into the woods for a few moments alone.

**Just (don’t) dance**


Our reception was anything but traditional. No dancing (not really our thing), a dessert table instead of a sheet cake (best idea ever - my friends brought different desserts and we had the best variety of amazing homemade desserts!), and no tables/separate chairs for the reception (to encourage mingling). It was the craziest feeling to have everyone I loved from different walks of life all in the same area. I have moved 7 times growing up and went to 8 different schools, so having people from each of those places meant so much to me. Everything about our wedding and reception was just so absolutely perfect. Everything was exactly what I wanted and more meaningful than I could have even planned.

**Eating in the car**


And as many people on their wedding day end up doing, I skipped dinner (it was so distracting having everyone there talking to me at once!) and luckily we had some extra sandwiches and desserts that I finally got to devour as Ruben drove us away. We drove out with a car full of food, thoughtful gifts, and sweet memories that will never be lost. Thank you to everyone who made this day so special, giving me warm feelings even now, almost 3 years later.
