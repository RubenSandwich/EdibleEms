The book [Eat the Yolks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1628600195?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=1628600195), by Liz Wolfe, has completely and forever changed the way I view food (and really a lot of other things too). No matter what your nutrition dogma or food preferences are, this book will speak to you and make you think about health from a holistic and logical perspective.

There are only 4 chapters, each one about a different macronutrient. Fat, protein, carbs, and nutrients are the four different macronutrients that all human beings need to survive. Fat? Yes, surprisingly we do need a certain amount of fat (including saturated fat!) for our brain health (and more). I learned this and many other surprising facts in this book!

If you aren’t into science and nutrition-y stuff, this book is great for you too because it actually focuses on the history behind governmental and other nutritional recommendations by “experts.” This history is as crucial to know as are the nutrition facts, as you will see when you read this book.

**Introduction**

Beautifully stated and inspiring. That pretty much describes this whole book, but especially in the introduction as a preview of the book’s findings on page 16:

*“Turns out, it wasn’t about willpower. It was about eating some emotion-balancing, hunger-regulating, body-nourishing real food and, above all, learning what junk was - and eliminating it.”*

**Chapter 1: Fat**

With subtitles like “Let’s talk about fat, baby”, “What really causes heart disease?”, and  “Saturated science? Fat chance”, Wolfe sure captures (and holds!) your attention. The witty writing is just the icing on the (paleo-friendly?) cake, but the real meat of the this chapter is its enlightening insights into why fat is good for you, what kinds to eat and what to avoid, and what all of the hype about saturated fat and cholesterol is really about.

	Key takeaway points:

* Avoiding fat does not make you healthier. With the increased awareness about heart disease and subsequent avoiding of fat, our society has still not seen a decrease in these illnesses. So it is not necessarily the fact that is the problem (read on).

* Plant-based oils are highly processed before they come to us in stores. Also, none of them are actually made from plants.

* Corn is a grain not a plant, soybeans are legumes, canola oil comes from a seed, and cottonseed oil comes from cotton. None of those are vegetables.

* Cholesterol is natural and too little cholesterol is actually extremely harmful.

* Fat does not make you fat.

**Chapter 2: Protein**

This chapter not only answers questions such as “Is eating red meat cancer causing?” And “Does eating meat raise cholesterol?” But it also discusses the ethical implications of eating animals. It is no small thing to take a life, and this is an important and legitimate question that many people grapple with, especially with the rise of vegetarianism and veganism. Wolfe answers these moral questions with genuine grace, thoughtfulness, and a caring attitude while being practical and taking into account science and environmental issues.

I especially appreciated this chapter as it answered some of the questions I had been wrestling with for years.

	Key takeaway points:

* Meat does not cause cancer, harm the kidneys, or stress the liver.

* Plant protein contains anti-nutrients, which block the absorption of nutrients.

* Thinner is not healthier.

* Many have compared humans’ diets to those of apes, yet our digestive system is vastly different. For example, our digestive system is less than 60% of the mass that a primate of the same size would have.

* Growing foods such as rice, corn, and beans (staples of a vegetarian/vegan diet) can harm many organisms and the environment. Environmental ethicalism should not focus on what you eat as much as it is how it is produced.

**Chapter 3: Carbs**

There seem to be either two camps when it comes to this subject. One, is that everybody should eat low carb (and generally that camp says to also eat higher fat). The other is that everybody should eat lots of carbs (and generally that camp says to also eat lower protein).

Wolfe explains the history behind agriculture and how our society came to eat the way we do now, why crops today are not like they were thousands of years ago, how the body actually uses different types of carbs, what the deal is with gluten, fiber, and what we actually need to be eating!! Of course there is not an exact plan for who should be eating what, but this framework has helped me a lot to decide how to incorporate carbohydrates into my diet in a healthy way.

My favorite quote in this chapter was:

*“The only food is the food that has always been food.”*

	Key Takeaway Points:

* Just because a food contains certain amounts of minerals and nutrients, doesn’t mean our body can use them if they aren’t what we are meant to eat.

* Pasteurization actually destroys the healthy part of dairy products.

* There is no such thing as a gluten deficiency!

* Grains, beans, & legumes are actually all seeds and have highly concentrated anti-nutrients.

* Eating every 2-3 hours does not actually keep your metabolism running, but contributes to us not being able to properly digest our foods.

* Fat intake has nothing to do with blood sugar or insulin.

* “It’s not about willpower or moderation. It’s about eating the right foods.”

**Chapter 4: Nutrients**

This chapter has completely changed my view of what I eat. I have spent my whole life until reading this book focusing on the quantity of food that I eat and the macronutrients that the food has (so basically only looking at protein, fat, and carbs instead of thinking about how these foods will be handled by my body).

	Key takeaway points:

* Calories & nutrients: Wolfe distinguishes that it does not matter the calories you it, but rather whether or not your body will have the energy it needs through your foods. In other words, one calorie from a donut is not equal to one calorie or broccoli: your body utilizes different types of foods in different ways, despite all these “studies” saying that you can still lose weight eating 1200 calories of twinkies. It DOES matter what you eat, more so than the quantity you eat.

* Hormones: If you’ve ever wondered about hormones and whether or not they are important, this has a lot of answers for you. This chapter also provides clarity about these issues, and explains why sometimes you can be eating less and your body still stores the food you eat as fat. This shatters the myth that restricting what you eat is the way to lose weight.

* Vitamin D: Wolfe covers all of the major nutrients, but this particular one stuck out to me because of the history of skin cancer in my family. I’ve always wondered why rates of skin cancer keep increasing even with all of the careful sunscreen lathering going on, and Wolfe’s suggestions for how to practice safe sun exposure were extremely enlightening.

* Omega-3’s: Buzzword and popular supplement, this nutrient is also worth looking further into. Claiming to fight issues as serious as heart disease and as seemingly-vain as acne, anyone would want to know how to get this important nutrient into their body and whether or not they should supplement.

* Calcium: Also a curiosity of mine, since I cannot eat dairy (hence my [dairy free milkshakes](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/banana-mocha-milkshake) and [dairy free tacos](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/fish-tacos)).

I haven’t even covered half of what is in this chapter, but I am glad Wolfe was so thorough and somehow stayed entertaining at the same time as talking about iron, phosphorus, and hormones! As always, she ends with a “What to do” section and some great action items from the takeaway points.

**Conclusion**


This book has made me feel enlightened, yet not guilty or panicked that I have been doing things wrong. After reading it, I have slowly changed my lifestyle and way of eating and felt increasingly better as I have made different switches.

As if the book was not inspiring enough, here is where Wolfe leaves us:

*"If it's worth doing, it's worth doing poorly at first" (pg 261).*

*If nothing else, this book encouraged me to [buy local](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/community-supported-agriculture), whole foods!*
