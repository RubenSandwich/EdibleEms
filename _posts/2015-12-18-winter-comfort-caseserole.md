I know casseroles get a bad-rap a lot of times, but this dish will please anyone! The sun dried tomatoes give it such a unique flavor and after being baked, this recipe becomes a perfect balance of starch, protein, and veggies and perfectly in between too moist and too dry.

**Sun Dried Tomato Spaghetti Squash Bake**

*Serves 4-6*

  Ingredients:
  
* 1 small spaghetti squash

* 1 lb ground beef (or other ground meat of your choice)

* 1 T butter, olive oil, or coconut oil

* 1 large onion

* 2-3 cloves garlic

* 1 cup tomato sauce (no added sugar, salt, or flavorings - just pureed tomatoes is fine)

* 2 green onions

* 1 8oz (or so) jar of sun dried tomatoes, marinated in olive oil (marination is optional, but adds a lot of flavor to the dish)

* 3 T fresh parsley

* Goat cheese to taste, optional

  Directions:
  
1. Cook the spaghetti squash. You can either do this in the crockpot or in the oven. Be sure to add water so the squash cooks a bit nicer. 

2. Once the squash is cooked, removed the strings and store in your refrigerator for up to 3 days ahead of time.

3. An hour or so before you are ready to have dinner, gather all of the ingredients. This recipe is a layering game, so it helps to have everything set out ahead of time! Go ahead and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

4. Cook the ground beef in the butter (or other desired fat) over medium heat in a frying pan. While the beef is cooking, chop the onion and add it as soon as you are done chopping. Then mince the garlic cloves and add them too. Continue stirring occasionally until the meat is fully cooked.

5. While the mixture is cooking, grease a casserole dish and add the cooked spaghetti squash followed by the tomato sauce.

6. Once the beef mixture is done cooking, add salt & pepper, stir, and then place on top of the spaghetti squash in the casserole dish.

7. Chop the green onions and scatter on top of the squash along with the sun dried tomatoes.

8. Top with parsley and goat cheese (optional - only if you can tolerate dairy).

9. Bake for approximately 30 minutes to allow for the flavors to combine.
