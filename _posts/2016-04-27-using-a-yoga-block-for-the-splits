Using a yoga block ([this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008R6WRFU?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B008R6WRFU&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) is the one I use) has been instrumental in my [challenge to do the splits](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/splits-challenge) on at least one side. 

A [friend and yoga instructor](https://www.facebook.com/auroralyraunionyoga/?rc=p) mentioned it to me several weeks ago and I am so grateful! It makes a huge difference!

**Here is how I have found my [yoga block](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008R6WRFU?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B008R6WRFU&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) to be useful:**

<br>

1.) General support - placing it under my hip or upper thigh really helps me to hold the stretch longer and keep my weight off my hands.

2.)  For balance - just having it there helps my back stay stable and allows me not have to crouch all the way to the floor.
