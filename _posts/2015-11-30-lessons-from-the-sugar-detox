If you have been following my blog for the past few weeks, you will have noticed that practically everything I have been posting has been related to [The 21-Day Sugar Detox](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936608111?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1936608111&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20). I decided to do this challenge **for the third time** this November.

*Being on the detox brought out my creative side! Check out my sugar-detox friendly recipes for [Pumpkin Almond Butter](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/sugar-detox-friendly-pumpkin-almond-butter) and [Loaded Baked Green Apples](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/loaded-baked-green-apples).*

<span style="font-size: 22px;"><div style="color: purple;">Why do the 21-Day Sugar Detox?</span></div>

As opposed to other programs, the 21DSD is a **whole foods based** program that does not ask you to starve yourself or punish yourself at all. Rather, it just focuses on replacing your meals with hearty, real food and allowing the other details to fall into place. If you simply eat real healthy food, you will naturally start to want sweets less. 

The decision to do a challenge in the first place was twofold:

1. To reset my eating habits. I had let way too many bad habits slip back into my life in the past few months and just wanted a few weeks to get back to eating healthy, whole foods without so many unnecessary and frequent treats.

2. The challenge of it!  I have tried a no sugar challenge several times before and never successfully completed it, so I had a huge motivation to try it again, just for the satisfaction of it (not to mention all the health benefits)!

*Meal planning is a huge help for this program! I used the meal plans from the [21-Day Sugar Detox book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936608111?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1936608111&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) (she also has a [cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936608138?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1936608138&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) with even more recipes!) and it helped remove a lot of stress.*

<span style="font-size: 20px;"><div style="color: purple;">Did I Cheat?</span></div>

Short answer: Yes.

Long answer: Unintentionally eating foods I was not supposed to happened actually several times. 

**The first time** I was completely not thinking and popped some dried figs I had in my baking cupboard into my house. I usually snack a bit while eating dinner (another bad habit I noticed that needs to be fixed during the detox) and as I was looking for spices I grabbed some figs and ate them without thinking about it until later. Whoops! I am not too worried about this though, as it was still a whole foods and I hardly had any. I do not feel like I need to **redo the detox,** although next time I will be more careful to **remove all non-detox foods from my home** before I start the detox.

**The second time** was intentional though. You know how I told you that **potato chips are my weakness?** Well, I splurged on eating some potato chips while over at a neighbor's house to watch a football game. Looking back at it, I realized that this cheat was **completely preventable.** I knew that we would be coming to the party yet I did not plan ahead. How could I have thought that I would have been able to resist junk food, especially within my first week of the detox? I do not think the answer was to avoid this event, but rather to **eat right before the party** in addition to **bringing a healthy, fun treat** to share with everybody (and to eat myself!). I was pretty down on myself after this, but I am glad that overall it was not much food (just a handful of chips or so) and I still felt incredible benefits from being on the detox. 

Overall, I did way better than I ever have before, so I consider it a success. Next time I'll be even better, too!

*Why didn't I just bring fruit to munch on???*

<br>

<span style="font-size: 20px;"><div style="color: purple;">Lessons Learned:</span></div>

1. Coconut cream + bananas + cinnamon = heavenly. Especially the third week, after eating nothing sweet for two weeks! Want to step it up a notch further? **Freeze your bananas.** Tastes just like candy!

2. Sugar cravings can be (in large part) caused by simply not eating enough during the day. I did not realize how much I counted on sweet foods to complete my day's food intake in the evenings. The first few days I got hungry after dinner, which made me realize that I needed to be eating more overall throughout the day. I do not worry about eating more, since I am eating **nutrient dense foods that fill me up** rather than filling up with sugary desserts.

3. Too many nuts can cause acne. The first week I bought almond butter AND sun butter to help when I had sweet cravings. I do not know why, but nut butters seem to help satisfy sweet cravings for me. Even though it helped me not splurge on sweets, it still did not make me feel my best. **Don't go nuts on nuts if you do not want acne!** 

4. Eating the same foods forces one to be creative. It also makes meal planning easier to just simply have a list of foods that I can say "I am eating these foods right now" and a list of foods that I am just not eating right now.

<span style="font-size: 20px;"><div style="color: purple;">Would I do it Again?</span></div>

Absolutely yes! I had such a great experience with the program this round and I feel so incredible after eliminating sugar for several weeks. Although I cannot live like this all the time (gotta have pie at Thanksgiving dinner of course!), it is a great reset and fun challenge to do every so often.

I particularly liked completing this challenge in November because I feel like it has put me into the holiday season with the right mindset and with better control. Plus it ended right in time for Thanksgiving!

*I was so happy that sushi with a moderate amount of rice is included on the 21DSD!*
