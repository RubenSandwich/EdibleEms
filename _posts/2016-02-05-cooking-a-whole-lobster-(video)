Oh my gosh you guys, I cannot believe that I did this! 

I apologize for the lack of visibility in the video. You can see my reaction very well but can't see the details of what we are doing. Nevertheless, it proves that I actually completed my third goal of the year and had fun while doing it!

For those of you wondering about trying it yourselves, I am sure that you can see from the video that **it is much easier to do than most people think.** I'd suggest getting a friend (two hands are helpful), tongs, and a big pot, and you're good! Plus, they usually come with their pinchers tied so no worries there. :)
