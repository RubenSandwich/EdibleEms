You can spend way too much on charcol face masks, face lotion, and face washes. Here, I combine all three into one product that you can made for pennies. Take 5 minutes to make this and you can clean, exfoliate, and moisturize your face for months afterward.

*Tips for Use:*

* Work into face and leave on face for 5-10 minutes to let the charcol draw out the dirt on your face

* Wash with soap that is ok for your face, it is a bit difficult to get off without

* It doesn't take much, just a teaspoon or so usually works fine

* You may need more or less olive oil, just add enough to make it smear on your face rather than just fall off in clumps
