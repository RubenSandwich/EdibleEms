*Serves 2*

Last weekend Ruben and I went to the Annual Apple Tasting Festival at the Portland nursery. It was completely free, and so much fun. I never knew there were so many varieties of apples! There were over 50 different kinds, and we got to try them all.

After the tasting, we shopped through their many buckets of apples and pears â€“ all for 99 cents a pound! We bought quite a lot of apples and I created this recipe to use some of them in a more creative way. Baking apples naturally releases a sweet flavor, and adding just a touch of maple syrup and cardamom turns them into a flavorful dessert or snack.

Ingredients:

* 2 apples

* 2 tablespoons maple syrup

* 1 teaspoon cardamom

* Sea salt

Directions:

1. Halve, core, and slice apples. They bake faster when they are cut into slices, and make for easier serving.

2. Place the slices in a baking dish or cookie sheet (I used this [pie dish](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0069KDUXO?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B0069KDUXO&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20), but if you are making more than two, definitely use a bigger pan or dish). Make sure none of them overlap so that they can bake evenly.

3. Add 1-2 T maple syrup, depending on how sweet you like them. Sprinkle the cardamom and just a pinch of sea salt over the apples.

4. Bake at 350 for about 15 minutes, depending on how thick your slices are. They should be soft enough for a fork to easily slide into them.

5. Enjoy as a snack or a light dessert (perhaps with ice cream, if you can tolerate dairy)!
