*That big stack of books that you haven't read yet been mocking you? Well read this and maybe you will change your perspective about goal-setting and self-improvement.*

Is anybody out there still thinking about their New Year’s Resolutions?

Likely not.

This is such a major frustration of many people, forever trying to be better and finally get themselves to do X (or to not do X). New Year’s Goals are classic examples of this, only lasting about a month or so before they fade away from our lives. And I’m not saying that it’s bad to strive for improvement, but sometimes it seems more discouraging than helpful.

**How can we strike a balance between aiming to be the best versions of ourselves and yet not overstressing ourselves with unrealistic expectations?**

I have struggled with this for years and although I still struggle to an extent, I think I have found myself to be largely in charge of the bar height I put on myself.

**This is how I overcome the toxic mindset of doing too much and subtly placing my self-worth on my performance: I set my expectations lower.**

This sounds like I am not going to be accomplishing as much and, well, I guess it is.

But think about it: when you push yourself too hard, especially with things outside of work and your regular routines, it often backfires. You work hard all day and are challenged a lot at your job, then you try to do something else in your life but you only have a limited bandwidth after all of the “other” tasks that just come along with being an adult.

So why stress yourself out more? Why work harder to do less? We all know we aren’t productive when we try to do too much and burn out, so then why do we keep trying?

I say have expectations to do less than you think you can when it comes to self-improvement, goal setting, and habit formation. Things always take longer than you think they will, and it is much better to do something right and make small steps of progress steadily.

How does this relate to my new year’s goals?

Well, I had a series of [6 goals for the new year](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/new-years-challenges) that were all completely fun and mildly challenging. I have completed 3 out of these 6 (one I have yet to write about!) and am ready to tackle the final 3!

Come follow along as I [cook a live lobster](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/goal-3-of-2016-cooking-a-whole-lobster), join a CSA (more on that soon), and [make some fun new culinary creations](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/poached-eggs)!

*Joining a team is a great way to encourage yourself to be pushed in a fun, healthy way while being social at the same time!*
