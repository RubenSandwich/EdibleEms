The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide is the industry standard when it comes to implementing procedures and processes for successful project management. Along with utilizing PMBOK’s methods in my profession as a development engineer for a global specialty metals producer, I also apply many of the principles to my home life as well. 

By following these methodologies, I’m routinely able to accomplish an enormously important task whose failure would basically put my whole existence in jeopardy. That task is (cue “dun Dun DUNNNNN!”)…making dinner for my super-demanding son and my super-picky wife.

I get home from work every day at 5:30pm. My wife picks up our son from daycare after she’s finished with work, and depending on traffic and his willingness to leave* they get home around 6:00pm. That leaves me thirty minutes, thirty-five tops, to have our meal prepared and on the table. 

I have to get it all done before they get home because once my son bursts through the front door, he just runs circles around the kitchen island while screaming that he wants to “help” me cook. Though my wife’s presence isn’t a physical impediment to the cooking process, her distaste for many culinary staples like seafood and pretty much all vegetables make it tough to plan relatively healthy meals that we all can enjoy.

Thankfully, I’ve been successful in satisfying the needs of my stakeholders by incorporating Project Management Process Groups into my meal planning and preparing procedures. Below are the five groupings, along with the implementation actions associated with my particularly unique project. Bon appetit!

* Not only does my son kick and scream when it’s time to drop him off at daycare in the morning, he also kicks and screams when we show up to take him home at night. I thought that raising a kid would be easy from all the episodes of Teen Mom that I watched, but it’s actually turning out to be quite tough!

1.) Initiating

During the initiating step, the tasks’ objective, stakeholders and budget are identified and defined. For my family dinner project, the goal is to serve up moderately-healthy dinners Sunday through Thursday* to my wife and son at 6:00pm. I only have two key stakeholders, but their expectations are both diverse and demanding. Budget isn’t necessarily a constraint, unless you count “not being rich enough to hire a personal chef” as one.

* Friday and Saturday dinners are preordained for pizza and leftover pizza respectfully. 

2.) Planning

The planning step is where the necessary action plans are developed to achieve the project objectives. I’ve created a spreadsheet that tracks our current meal inventory, along with recording the dates when they were last served. I use this information to lay out my menu weeks in advance, and also to make sure I replenish meals as we eat them. #Kanban

Along with the current meal lineup, I also strive to add new items every month or so. My selection criteria when evaluating new recipes are: 1) the meal must be able to be frozen for future reheating, and 2) it must not contain an overabundance of ingredients that my wife and son don’t like.

3.) Executing

This step is where the actual cooking is done! I’m not a great cook by any means, but my engineering sensibilities do make me a helluva good recipe follower. To increase my efficiency, I also try to prepare for the next evening’s meal as much as possible while the present one is cooking to minimize non-value added steps from my process. #Lean

4.) Monitoring and Controlling

This one is easy. If the meal turns out bad, I remove it from my spreadsheet and never make it again. My wife won’t spare my feelings when espousing her culinary opinions*, and my son will literally spit food out if it isn’t agreeable to his pallet. And since his appetite is constantly changing, I have to be diligent in managing my inventory system to not be left with an overstock of undesirable items in the freezer. 

* She once told me that my enchiladas tasted like Fancy Feast. How she knows what Fancy Feast tastes like is beyond me…

5.) Closing

Formal finalization of this project will not be achievable until my son’s away at college so I’ve got a long way before that happens.
