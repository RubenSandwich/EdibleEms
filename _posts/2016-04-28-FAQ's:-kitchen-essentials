**There aren't many tools required to have a healthful kitchen, but these are my few must-haves for anyone at any point in their cooking career.**

<br>

1.) Good knives

<br>


This is so obvious, but it honestly makes a huge difference. Knives are the #1 tool I use for absolutely every meal and I cannot do a day without them.

[This](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R1ZMOU6?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00R1ZMOU6&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) is the set that I currently own and like. They are not super high quality, but all I have to do is sharpen them every few weeks and they are great. Plus, the block holder is super nice for organization purposes!

If you need a knife sharpener, [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C8D5F0G?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B01C8D5F0G&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) is similar to the one I use and love.

2.) Quality cutting boards

<br>

I got this cutting board at my bridal shower and LOVE it. It is functional and looks beautiful. I often times even serve food on it when I am feeling fancy. :)

I could not find the exact same one that I have, but [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J5Y5NAY?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00J5Y5NAY&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) is by the same brand and I am sure would work just the same. 



*Another tip: Be sure to have a separate meat and vegetable cutting board. Even if you clean thoroughly, there is always the chance that there are bacteria from the meat that may contaminate the vegetables. It cannot hurt to be safe!*

<br>

3.) Cast iron skillet

*Don't judge my messy stovetop!*

<br>

I do not know why I waited so long to get one of these. I keep my cast iron on the stove at all times and use it for practically everything. It works so much better than any other pan and you do not have to clean it every time! I usually just wipe it off or scrub it with a little steel wool (no soap!) and it is good to go.


I use a [Lodge Brand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G2XGC88?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00G2XGC88&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20), which is pretty inexpensive and will last forever. Plus, the [silicone handle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QM8W5S?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B004QM8W5S&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) is a great way to prevent your hand from getting burned! I highly suggest getting one if you already have a cast iron skillet!

<br>

4.) Pots & pans





![IMG_2261.JPG](/content/IMG_2261-JPG.jpg)

<br>

The [pots and pans that I use](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009L16ZBM?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B009L16ZBM&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) were from my mother for (the best ever!) wedding present. I use them EVERYDAY. Every. Day. They clean like a breeze due to the ceramic coating and never ever burn stuff. Yay Mom!

General use pots and pans are incredibly useful for any type of cook and you will probably use them every single day. I feel silly adding these since I know most people have them, but my encouragement is that if you have poor quality, non-stick pans, that you will consider switching to [pans with a ceramic coating](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008AP5BVK?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B008AP5BVK&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) and making cleaning dishes so much easier!

<br>

5.) Food processor

<br>



Why should you get a [food processor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AXM4SB6?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B01AXM4SB6&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20)? I'll tell you why: it makes absolutely EVERYTHING easier and saves SO MUCH MONEY! I can now make my own hummus, frostings, creamy soups, etc. etc. etc.! I thought it would be a drag to get it out and clean it all the time, but it really is not. Plus, when I make something really messy I can just stick it in the dishwasher. 

I have a [Cuisinart](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AXM4SB6?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B01AXM4SB6&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) and I loooooove it! My siblings got together and all pitched in to get it for me many years ago and it is still going strong. Due to me dropping it (totally my fault, I'm so uncoordinated!), the bowl has cracked and I assumed I would have to get another one, but they sell parts separately so all I need to do is reorder one part, not get a completely new one! Good deal!

<br>

6.) Crockpot



![IMG_2259.JPG](/content/IMG_2259-JPG.jpg)

<br>

This is an especially important tool for the beginner cook: it's hard to mess up anything in a crockpot! You can see that I use mine so much that the front is completely faded and stained. Still works like a charm though!

You can get this same one [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UCG8II?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B003UCG8II&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20). Only $20 and I've had mine for 5 years!
