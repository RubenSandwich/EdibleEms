All of the lovely wintery starches have gotten a lot of attention lately. Well, all of them except parsnips! You hear about pumpkin of course in the fall, then spaghetti squash and butternut, and of course potatoes (everybody's favorite), but everybody has forgotten about poor parsnips! Well don't worry, because I remember and I know just how good they can be with a little love (or fat, salt, & spice!).

Option: After roasting, you can always blend the parsnips in a food processor with 2 T softened butter to make a **Parsnip Mash** instead.

<br>

	Ingredients:

* 1 lb parsnips

* 4 T olive oil

* Salt & pepper

* 1 T dried sage

* 4 sprigs fresh sage, optional (but really adds to the flavor and look of the dish!)


<br>

	Directions:

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Cut ends off parsnips and peel the outer hard layer of skin off with a peeler. I did not do that for these pictures, but I have had them both ways (peeled and unpeeled) and it is definitely better to peel them.

Then chop the parsnips in half....

...and in half again (quarters).

Place 2 T of olive oil on a baking sheet, then lay down the parsnips, sprinkle the remaining 2 T of olive oil over the parsnips and add salt & pepper along with the dried and fresh sage, if using.

Bake for 20-25 minutes (depending on your oven), flipping the parsnips halfway through.
