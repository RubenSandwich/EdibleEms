By the end of the day on Sunday, I have had my time to experiment with new recipes, cook some of [my favorite but longer recipes](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/stuffed-plantains), and maybe even do [a little baking](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/dense-chocolate-cake-with-dark-chocolate-drizzle). 

Sunday night dinner is supposed to be extra special, but ... And in my case, make a meal that makes lots of leftovers! I want to start the week off right, with leftovers in my fridge! This stir fry fits all of these criteria and more.

**Sunday Night Stir Fry**

*Serves 2*

<br>

	Directions:

1. Chop all of the mushrooms, the onion, and green beans into bite sized pieces. Crush the garlic in a garlic press or mince it finely.

2. Heat the oil or butter in a wok or large cast iron pan. Add the chopped vegetables from Step 1 but for the garlic. Let cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onions start to brown, then add the garlic and saut√© for 1 minute.

3. Add the salt & pepper and coconut aminos (or soy sauce, if desired), stir, and let cook for another 30 seconds or so.

4. Add the spinach to the pan and stir, letting it cook down for 1 minute or so. 

5. Once the spinach is cooked and turns dark green, your stir fry is ready! Transfer to plates or bowls and serve with rice, rice noodles, and sriracha sauce.
