Now that it's summer, I don't want to cook. BUUUUT, I do want to try these recipes, none of which require heating an oven or a stove, and all of which sound mouthwateringly good. Bring it on, summer heat! 

<br>

	1. Avocado Gazpacho 

I love all things avocado, especially being dairy free. I have tried most of the strange sounding avocado recipes like mousse, smoothies, and even cakes using avocados, but this summer a savory soup sounds in order! [This recipe](http://selfproclaimedfoodie.com/cucumber-avocado-basil-mint-gazpacho/) using basil and mint sounds too good! I will report back and let you know how it is. :)

	2. Spiralized Thai Salad from Against All Grain

Ever since I saw [her video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXNo2M4oL10), I have been antsy to try this recipe, especially now that I finally have a [spiralizer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BE77QL8?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B01BE77QL8) (my wonderful husband knew I had been wanting it and got it for me for Christmas).

*In fact, this video from last year may even have lingered into my memory and inspired my [Spiralized Green Apple Salad](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/spiralized-green-apple-salad)!*

	3. Pistachio ice cream 

Is it just me, or are pistachio desserts kind of a wanna-be hipster food? I mean, ESPECIALLY pistachio macarons. Doesn't get any more hipster than that. 

Hipsters have great taste in food, though, and honestly, they all make me want to try this recipe from [Dairy Free Ice Cream](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/162860039X?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=162860039X). This book is GENIUS (don't even get me started about the dairy free chocolate ganache!) and I absolutely cannot wait to start making ice cream again now that it is hot out. First up: pistachio!

*I may also have a very special creamy green recipe coming up for you guys soon!*

	4. Grilled peaches

I have been seeing these ALL OVER The Instagram and have yet to try them! I don't know if I just wasn't paying attention or if it is a new trend or something, but either way I MUST. TRY.

	5. Watermelon & feta

My curiosity just might make me splurge and eat some dairy sometime soon. This is another instagram idea that I keep seeing and although it sounds weird to me, at the same time I am dying to try it!
