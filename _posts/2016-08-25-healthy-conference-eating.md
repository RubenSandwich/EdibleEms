Fall is coming and lots of companies, clubs, and organizations are holding conferences on the weekends. I recently attended a conference for [ASCE](https://thekellydoyle.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/2016-ymls-recap/) and realized that it is a unique eating situation that I have yet to write about.

**The Challenges of Staying Healthy at a Conference**

<br>

First of all, unlike [road trips](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/road-trip-snacks), [vacations](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/boston-vlog), or [family time](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/9-ways-to-stay-healthy-during-the-holidays), you have zero control of your schedule. You must follow a pre-determined schedule with little or no free time to do your normal workouts, rest, and to cook.

Secondly, conferences typically have people eating together, which makes the social pressure even higher.

<br>

**To combat the conference eating scene difficulties and temptations, here are my tips;**

<br>

a.) Go for the healthiest options. Most caterers at conferences are used to picky people, so use this to your advantage! Simple pick and choose the healthiest options and just load up on those! For example, my conference had a taco bar, so I just got everything but the cheese and tortilla shells. Easy!

<br>

b.) Fruit as a filler.

Caterers nearly always serve fruit as a side dish, but go ahead an use it as either a filler if there aren’t enough other healthy veggie options, or as a dessert when everyone else is eating their cookies! You’ll feel much better sticking with real foods.

c.) Out for a networking dinner? Try these tips:

* Order nothing which says that it is fried, breaded, or crispy, but instead try steamed, roasted, or poached. It is the cooking oils that are the worst part of going out to eat.

* Stay away from the calorie-laden drinks. I know it’s hard, but limiting yourself on the alcohol and fancy coffee drinks can pay off big time.

d.) Salads, salads, salads! Whenever you can, eat salad!
Bulk up on the greens and veggies
Bring your own dressing

e.) Thoughtful treats are key.

* [Boulder Canyon Chips](https://www.amazon.com/Boulder-Canyon-Kettle-Cooked-Potato/dp/B014GCS5FY/ref=sr_1_2_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1472173061&sr=8-2&keywords=boulder+canyon+chips) (pictured below) have less salt and industrial seed oils, but use avocado or olive oil instead. They are fairly easy to find all over the country and would make a great treat/snack to store in your purse or bag.

* Snack on fruit when possible.

* Bring your own granola bars, jerky, nuts, dried fruit, dark chocolate, and other snacks to tide you over and help you not go overboard on unhealthy meal options.

f.) Finally, don’t fear perfection! I got this salad filled with cheese as a treat while at the conference and yes it made me break out but honestly I did not worry about it! Sometimes it’s ok to break the rules and you may even do more good allowing exceptions if it makes you relax a bit more. So don’t stress out!
