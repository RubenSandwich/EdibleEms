I believe sage is a spectacular spice that is often forgotten and underappreciated. It has a bit of a unique flavor so it cannot simply be added to any dish, but it goes perfectly in in this recipe and makes for a much nicer presentation. This recipe also uses ground chicken. What I love about ground meat is that it is so versatile – see print in Italics for suggestions of how to make this recipe stretch for two meals.

This dish is incredibly simple and perfect for a weeknight dinner. 




*Ingredients:*

* 1/2 lb ground turkey (opt. use 1 lb and have leftovers for a breakfast frittata the next day)

* 1 T olive oil, coconut oil, or butter 

* 4 portabella mushroom caps, stems removed

* ¼ cup tomato sauce

* Salt & pepper

* Fresh sage

*Directions:*

1.	Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
2.	Cook the chicken or turkey in a sauté pan over medium heat with olive oil, coconut oil, or butter. 
3.	When the chicken has cooked, turn the heat to low and add the salt, pepper, and tomato sauce. Cook for 2 or 3 more minutes on low so that the flavors can mix a bit.
4.	While chicken is cooking, wash the mushrooms and grease a baking pan or dish. Set the mushrooms on the dish and fill with the chicken and tomato mixture once it is finished. If using 1lb of chicken, set aside half of the mixture after the tomatoes are cooked in and save as a breakfast hash for the following day(s).
5.	Bake for about 10 minutes, or until mushrooms are cooked through
6.	Top with fresh sage and serve immediately.


Notes:

* Pairs well with a green salad, yellow squash, or zucchini noodles

* Can also substitute chopped fresh tomatoes or tomato paste
