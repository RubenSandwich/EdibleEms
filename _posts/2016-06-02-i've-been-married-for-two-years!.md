Last Tuesday we celebrated two years of being married.

Since I love to cook, I am sure nobody would be surprised to hear that I wanted to make us a special meal at home (Yellow Squash Dairy-Free Shrimp Fettuccine). Sorry, no food pictures - I was too busy enjoying my cute date!

*Can you blame me?!?*

I do not, however, enjoy baking, but I do very much enjoy a good dessert on occasion. We decided to go to this a-little-bit-too-stuffy-but-excellent-food-and-even-better-view restaurant just for dessert. I would never go there again but I sure wish they would tear the restaurant down and make it into an overlook park… Seriously. Or at least a casual-nice restaurant, coffee shop, or just anything with a deck! (I still cannot believe they didn’t have an overlook deck at all! Indoor photos just do not turn out the same.) Anyway, the people there were so cool that as we were sitting down at 7:30pm to have dessert, most others were there just starting their dinners! 

We had a wonderful dessert and enjoyed just taking time on a weekday to relax, chat, and visit a new part of town.

**A Realization**

My [realizations from last year](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/marriage-and-wedding-cakes) have not been altered, but over the past year and from reflecting on our relationship journey overall has just added to that. I could write a good sized ebook with all of my thoughts and experiences, but considering this is just a blog post I will stick to the main thought that we have been noticing in our relationship as we reflect on year two. 


This is it: Strife occurs when we do NOT spend time together. Nothing bad needs to happen, nobody needs to say anything mean, all that needs to happen is that we go for a time without spending quality time together and things seem to start to go downhill. Feelings are more easily hurt, bitterness creeps in with no reason behind it, and loneliness hits.

Then we don’t feel like spending time together, and the problem only perpetuates.

To make things even more complicated, sometimes we can go for longer times without dates and are fine, while other times it seems like we need time together every day. The time that we need to spend together is not a consistent, magic number.

Now when I say “strife,” I guess I should clarify that I do not just mean fights, because often times as we experience this we do not fight, however one or both of us will slowly start to feel forgotten and then get bitter and our interactions become cold and even unfriendly.

**Us Lately**

The month leading up to our anniversary happened to be an extremely busy one for us as I started a new job after thinking for so long I was going to be working from home as a freelance technical writer. I will have a post on that story soon, but essentially this meant a huge shift in schedules and a lot more time either apart, or doing chores when we were together. Although doing chores together is a lot more fun than doing them apart, it does not take the place of connection time.

I admit that it is me who is the more time-needy between the two of us. During this season in our relationship, I started feeling unwanted and lonely, even though Ruben and I were together every evening and weekend. I had spent the 3 years prior to being married living on my own and felt fine, but once you get used to being in that close of a relationship, it feels extra depressing to not have that “close-ness.” Especially when the person you love is in the same room yet it seems difficult to spend time together.

As our anniversary approached, we began reminiscing, realizing that wow, we have almost been married for 2 whole years (and have been together for 6). Considering this history and our deep commitment to each other, we realized that our marriage was not in the place we wanted it to be in. 

Not that things were horrible, but they were getting to a place where we were prone to hurting each other, and any romance was just mediocre overall. I thought this would be such a difficult process and that we had only begun after this conversation, but soon after spending *intentional, one-on-one time together regularly* for several weeks, things slowly started to become back to where they had once been.

Now, we look forward to and actively construct ways to spend even more time together, which only reinforces our affection towards each other.

**My Advice**

Spending regular time together, not just to get the “business stuff” (running a household, bills, etc.), is imperative to our functioning as a couple. This may mean a simple at home date or a walk around the neighborhood, but more often than not (at least for us, I am not sure how other couples are), we have to get out of the house. We aim to switch it up between small dates (going to a tea shop and playing a board game before chatting for an hour or so) and entire weekends together (on a backpacking trip per say).

Remember that it takes a certain amount of time before deep conversation & connection can occur. Occassionaly we can connect with others deeply and suddenly (this is referring to friendships as well as partnerships), but more often than not it is necessary to spend time unwinding and letting your thoughts unravel in your own head before you can discuss with others. There is, unfortunately, no substitute for time and no shortcuts when it comes to relationship upkeep.

<br>

**Marriage is Hard Work**

This is not popular to say, but marriage takes a lot of intentionality and is genuinely difficult a lot of the time. As all relationships, though, the time and effort put into it is always worth it.
