<span style="font-size: 20px;">**Thankful**</span>

When I thought about starting Eat With Emily (at the time called Whole & Unrefined), one of my main concerns was not being able to create new content. I had a few ideas, but I have never been a particularly creative person, so the thought of consistently finding new ways to eat made the idea of starting a food website seem ludicrous. As the weeks went by and this persistent thought would not leave me, I felt like I just had to start a site, even to get the few ideas I had at the time out of my head. 

As soon as I wrote my [first post](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/three-ingredient-canned-peaches), the ideas came flocking. I could not get through a work day without thinking up something new I had to try. When I listen to podcasts or go to restaurants I have to bring a notebook to write down all the ideas that come to me. What started as an outlet for me to get this “phase” out has ironically made my head even more full of ideas. 

I have also become increasingly curious about nutrition and have been devouring any books and websites related to natural and holistic health. I am in love with not only the creation of food and recipes, but also learning about how the way we nourish our bodies directly affects our health. 

My hobby turned passion is to share my (very limited!) knowledge of food and health to anyone who is willing to learn.

 <span style="font-size: 20px;">**What will Eat With Emily look like from here on?**</span>

<br>

There is no question that I will continue to post (mostly) weekly recipes, as I currently have enough on my list to last a year! Here are some recipes to look forward to:

My goal is to create content more consistently and more frequently. I also hope to branch out to more **health related topics,** writing about the food/health related **books I am reading**, and thoughts about **food quality, justice, sustainability,** and **farming.** I will be doing research on my own and mostly for my own interests, and hope to share a bit about what I learn on the site. I also plan on doing a few challenges, including a **sugar detox,** which I will of course share all about.

I am welcome to suggestions about what you want to be reading and seeing here on Eat With Emily, so please leave a comment with any questions or thoughts you have and I will be sure to include those in my schedule! (I love researching all things food and nutrition, so **if you have a question or topic you are curious about but do not have the time to look into, please let me know!**) 

Thank you all for reading and sticking with me for this bumpy and wonderful first year!
