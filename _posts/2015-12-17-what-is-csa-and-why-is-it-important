As our economy has changed over the years, it has become increasingly **less local** and instead relied on transporting goods in general thousands of miles away. Transporting food for so many miles has especially has affected our health, environment and economy in many ways, as I am sure many of you are aware of.

This topic has become increasingly important to me as my interest in food has been growing and naturally I want to learn more about where my food comes from. 

<br>

<div style="color: purple;">As Wendell Berry says:

<br>

"To be interested in food, but not in food production is clearly absurd."</div>

<br>

<span style="font-size: 22px;">**Health Affects**</span>

It is well known that food which is taken out of the ground or picked early and then travelled thousands of miles has lost a lot of nutritional value between **being uprooted unnaturally early and the prolongated time traveling,** plus it often contains **harmful pesticides and fertilizers** that are not ideal for human consumption (not to mention harmful to the environment - more on that later). Mass production of food is also **nutrient depleting** in that it causes the same soil to be overused time and again, and the same vegetable grown in old soil just does not have the same nutritional benefits (see [this](http://robbwolf.com/2014/01/24/eating-close-home-saving-grace/) article, particularly point 4, for more information).

Not only that, but **it simply does not taste as good!** Have you ever gone to a farm stand for strawberries and noticed that they are practically like candy? Or have you grown your own tomatoes and realized that they taste nothing like the tomatoes in the store? To me, that alone is worth the switch to food grown closer to me!

<br>

<span style="font-size: 22px;">**Environmental Effects**</span>

The environment is another concern of mine which food production affects. Planting year after year in the same soil and adding harsh fertilizers causes food to grow quickly but unnaturally. This not only depletes the nutrient value and adds in unnecessary chemicals to our diets, but it also harms the earth. 

Here are just a few of the environmental hazards caused by mass food production:

* Animals that are near these practices frequently lose their homes due to the inhospitable soil and excess nutrient runoff. 

* Chemicals and fertilizers used in the farming process seep into the ground and contaminate many water sources.

* All of the fumes from the fertilizers add even more greenhouse gases into the air.

* Greenhouse gases? Let's not forget all of the greenhouse gases that are emitted when food is shipped for miles and miles!

<span style="font-size: 22px;">**Effects on the Economy**</span>

Our economy is also affected by this way of food production. Not only is buying cheap food from the grocery store causing harm to our health and the environment, it is often not giving adequate compensation to the farmers and people who produce the food and instead is putting money into the pockets of large corporations that produce cheaply **even though they have the money to do better.** Paying low wages to farmers a major way that these businesses get food to you so cheaply. [This article](http://www.sustainabletable.org/860/community-and-economy) talks about the negative effects of large scale farming on the economy in greater detail.

If people buy from local sources (farmer's markets, community supported agriculture, certain grocery stores, etc.), then our own communities will thrive and we will have a more sustainable food system in general. 

**What would happen if we could not get out shipments of bananas and chicken from other countries or major factories & farms?** 

We would have to start producing what we can in our own communities - and you would be surprised by how much of this is already happening if you just look for it!

*I had never even heard of Patty Pan squash before signing up for my CSA, and how it is one of my favorite squash varieties to eat!*


<br>

<span style="font-size: 22px;">**What to do then?**</span>

Support local! That is a huge factor in decreasing your carbon footprint, improving your health, and having more fun with food. 

There are so many ways to do this and it is easy to slowly become more and more local in your food choices. **I would start by just browsing your local farmer's markets and seeing just how much they have to offer**, and often at similar prices to grocery stores! 

Then I would research into ordering from farms and sign up for a CSA.

<br>

 <span style="font-size: 22px;">**Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)**</span>


Why do I prefer CSA's in general?

CSA's are a great way to stop the harmful cycle of growing and transporting food for thousands of miles and to work towards a local, more nutritious, and better-tasting food economy! Plus, they allow you to get food **directly from the farm.** Literally, farm-to-table!

Usually, a CSA farm will allow you to sign up for what is called a **share,** or even a **half-share.** These are boxes filled with produce, sometimes with options for also ordering eggs, meat, cheeses, and even coffee! They are delivered to your house or at a pickup location very close to your house either weekly or every other week.

<br>

*A typical half-share CSA box.*

<br>

I know that this information seems like a huge burden, but you can make a great deal of change by simply ordering your food, or even part of your food, from a local farm. A half share is not that much food and can easily be eaten by two people. So if you live alone, **find a friend to share your share with you!** (haha, share your share!)

To be completely honest, I have yet to become completely reliant on local foods. I get a **half CSA,** which provides most of the vegetables I eat but still leaves room for me to buy other foods when I want them and **not be overwhelmed with cooking vegetables I do not know how to use.** You have seen pictures all throughout this post of various items I have seen from my CSA this year. I have eaten such a variety of foods and had a surprisingly fun time experimenting and trying new foods!

I also have just begun ordering a **meat share,** which is even **easier** because if I cannot use all of the meat I simply freeze it! That can be a little bit harder to do with vegetables.

![Purple_Potatoes.jpg](/content/Purple_Potatoes.jpg)

*Where else could I have found these fun purple potatoes???*

<br>

The CSA had taught me how to use vegetables I had never even heard before, yet also given me a lot of "everyday" foods like potatoes and lettuce.  If you are feeling compelled to make a change but simultaneously overwhelmed, I would highly suggest trying a small vegetable CSA and seeing how it goes!
