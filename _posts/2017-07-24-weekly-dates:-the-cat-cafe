Last weekend we checked out the infamous [cat cafe](https://www.colonycafepgh.com/) that just opened in downtown Pittsburgh. I loved supporting this place because they take in cats from local shelters and give them a comfortable, relatively large, space to roam until someone decides to adopt.

*You may have seen my Instagram story that day, full of videos of cute kittens and lots of selfies. :)*

The cafe is two stories, the bottom half being a coffee and wine bar (can't go wrong with that!) and the top half is a space for cats and visitors.

The entire side of the top half is glass overlooking the cafe, so folks in the cafe area can still see the kitties waltzing around upstairs.

If you reserve a space for the upstairs ($8 a person and you can sign up online), you get an hour slot where you can take your drink upstairs and play with the cats! 

They have a variety of cats from kitten age to older adult and so many fun toys, comfy bean-bags, and a nice employee hanging out to answer questions.

*If I didn't already have a cat, I would have adoped this sweet guy.*

It was the best date idea (Ruben's idea!) and a surprisingly good time to catch up with each other while hanging out with the cats. For me, cats and coffee/wine with my husband, that is truly romantic. :)
