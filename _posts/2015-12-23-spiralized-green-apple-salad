This is such a great way to get kids (and adults) to eat their greens! Adding fruit to salad has been an obsession of mine of late. I just think the bitter mixed with pops of sweetness works so well together! 

	Salad:

* 2 cups mixed greens

* 1 medium green apple

* 1 T chopped walnuts

* 1 T fresh cranberries, chopped in half (optional)

Wash and place greens in a salad bowl. [Spiralize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCIWwSJafsk) the apple into desired thickness and set on top of the greens along with the walnuts and cranberries, if desired. The cranberries add a bitter pop that I really enjoy, but not everybody likes them. The salad is great without them too, or else with dried cranberries instead, which tend to be sweeter. Top with Simple Apple Cider Vinaigrette (recipe below) or any other dressing of choice.

*Note: If you do not own a [spiralizer](http://www.amazon.com/Spiralizer-Tri-Blade-Vegetable-Strongest-Heaviest-Gluten-Free/dp/B00GRIR87M?ie=UTF8&creativeASIN=B00GRIR87M&linkCode=w00&linkId=N6PMPIBNIGUEFZFX&ref_=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til&tag=edib0a-20), you can use a [julienne peeler](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CCY1S?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B0000CCY1S&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20), or even chop the apples up into bite-sized pieces instead.*
