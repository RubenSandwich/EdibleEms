This is an incredibly simple salad that I whip up to go with dinner at least twice every week. I always, always have greens in my fridge and some kind of nuts in the cupboard, so even if I do not have an avocado a simple green salad garnished with nuts and a great dressing make a great pair.

	Ingredients:

* 1 avocado

* 4 cups mixed greens (whatever is in season - pictured is kale, lettuce, and bok choy from my CSA)

* Sliced almonds, pine nuts, or any other nut garnish

* 3 T of any dressing you like (I usually like something sweet to balance the bitter greens, such as my peach & cinnamon balsamic vinaigrette found [here](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/salad-season-cinnamon-peach-infused-balsamic-vinaigrette))

	Directions:


1. Chop avocado into bite-sized pieces.
