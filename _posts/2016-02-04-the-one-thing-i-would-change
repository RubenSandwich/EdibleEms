I often hear people comment on how overwhelmed they are with trying to change their nutrition habits for the better. They are right, really. A complete overhaul on our diet is what most people following the SAD (Standard American Diet) need. Most people are fighting with 20+ years of eating a certain way, and changing these habits is difficult. 

Even if you are a relatively healthy person, I think all of us are pretty far from optimal health in a lot of ways, mostly due to the way our current society is set up, but that is a subject for another way. 

But do you have to change everything all at once? Do you have to go from poor or even just decent health to optimal health in one swing?

Which led me to the question: What is one thing, if I had to pick just one, that you can do to make a significant different in your health? Changing one thing certainly seems more manageable, and we all know that one change can set you on a motion toward many more improvements. 

**The one thing: breakfast.**

If you eat well on your first meal of the day, then a) that is 1/3 of your food for the day, automatically improved, and b) you are likely to continue eating this way throughout the day.

Plus, I know it puts me in a great mood for the day. 

Honestly, changing my breakfast (and morning habits in general), has led my further along on a path that I never thought I would reach in this amount of time. These recommendations are simply based on my experience, so follow them if you wish, but if they do not work for you that is perfectly fine. Find what does!

I would recommend having three types of food incorporated into your breakfast:

1) Protein (So often overlooked at breakfast, but how else is your brain supposed to get thinking?)

2) Healthy Fat (Avocado, olive oil, coconut oil, eggs, etc.)

3) Greens (Why not cram some more veggies into your diet? We all could use extra greens.)

*A classic breakfast for me: Greens, ground beef with onions and garlic, and a runny fried egg on top!*

I suppose I could expand this to your morning routine in general. Since relocating to Pittsburgh, I have changed my morning routine significantly. Gone are the days of getting up at 5:30am to rush out the door, eat breakfast in the car, and commute 50 miles to work. That was something I had to do at the time, but now that I have gotten a little reset and some time off, I realized that I cannot do that forever. My mornings have changed from frantic to restful. I try to get a little me time in every morning before I start the day, and that has made **a world of difference.**

*Even something as simple as sitting down to pet my cat helps my mindset throughout the day dramatically.*

**So how about you, what are your mornings like, and do you think it would help to slow them down at all?**
