Or should I say, THREE big announcements!

The first being that **I have been blogging for 2 full years!**

This site, started out of my passion to share healthy food with people, has grown to become so much more in the past 2 years.

I have developed way more recipes than I ever thought I would! After my initial 3 that I had in my mind while starting up the site, I thought I would maybe fizzle out. But, I decided to do it anyway and now the gates have opened and my mind is flooding with idea after idea of recipes to share. From [Paleo Chocolate Cake](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/dense-chocolate-cake-with-dark-chocolate-drizzle) to [Staying Healthy while Traveling for Work](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/healthy-conference-eating) to [Learning How to Cook a Lobster](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/goal-3-of-2016-cooking-a-whole-lobster), this have been such a fun experiment and has only made me even more excited about cooking!

**My second announcement is this:** I have branched out into fitness and holistic health with my interests and also my post topics. This topic of health as an all-encompassing lifestyle has got me thinking about my own life, and how I have been healed by more than just food. I am so (passionate?) about this, in fact, that **I have decided to pursue my certification as a CHEK Holistic Lifestyle Coach!** So stay tuned for some big exciting things (and hopefully more educated insights) to come!

**Ok third announcement:** to accompany my ever-growing site and expanding knowledge, this website will from here out be called [Edible Em’s](edibleem.com). I went ahead and hired [a wonderful graphic designer](http://illustratornate.com) to make a new logo and had my wonderful [husband](http://rubennic.com) redesign the site to be more user friendly and searchable. I think it looks great!

Now, I will still be posting plenty of recipes, don’t you worry! However, I felt like Eat With Emily limited me to only food. This new name shows that I am primarily about food and nutrition, but I can use it to “fill in the blank” so to say. Plus it sounds way better, let's be honest. :)

If you want to hear details about **what the heck the [CHEK program](http://chekinstitute.com) even is, why I’m doing it, how I can better help you with this certification, and why I am pursuing this when I have a perfectly good engineering job, then watch this:**
