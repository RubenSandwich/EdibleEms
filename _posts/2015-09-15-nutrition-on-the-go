I am super excited to share with you all about my very first nutrition seminar that I had the privilege of attending last weekend! I have been wanting to deepen my knowledge of nutrition for some time now, and this only made me more curious to learn more!

The seminar was taught by [Abby Bliss White](http://blissholistichealth.com). I know Abby through [Nourish Northwest](http://nourishnorthwest.com) in Portland. **Nourish Northwest** is a fitness center with classes such as TRX, HIIT, and bootcamp style workouts, as well as food and nutrition classes. It is a wonderful **community** which I have really enjoyed being a part of for the last couple of years.

Anyway, I follow Abby on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Bliss-Holistic-Health-217574368332511/timeline/?ref=br_tf) as well as on her [blog](http://blissholistichealth.com/category/blog/) and always enjoy her inspiring and informational content. Abbey is a **Chek Holistic Lifestyle Coach** (CHHC) as well as **AADP certified** (American Association of Drugless Practitioners) and is also TRX and yoga certified. I am sure I am also forgetting more of her certifications, too.... 

When I saw Abby post about this seminar I immediately had to sign up. Not only do I resonate with her teaching style and love her fitness classes I have attended, but the topic was absolutely perfect for my current season of life.

*The seminar was taught at Garden Bar, a restaurant in downtown Portland, OR.*

In the seminar, Abby covered the **major food groups to focus on** and then proceeded to explain to us the basics of a healthy diet and what that looks like. Although it seems basic, our society has really lost touch with how to eat in the last few years, as we have shifted from making everything ourselves to buying everything from a drive-through. 

She left us with a packet of **detailed notes** for how to incorporate veggies, clean proteins and fats, and healthy carbohydrates into our daily life. 

We focused on **filling our lives with the good stuff** in an effort to **cram out the bad stuff.** I really like this approach that is not about denying yourself, but about eating healthy foods first and then it is much easier to **say no to unhealthy foods.**

After an excellent information session, we broke into lunch! I had the **Bliss Detox Salad,** the recipe for which Abby created herself. It is Garden Bar's most popular salad, and I could see why!

We also learned about some specific brands and products of convenient **snack foods** Here is one brand I particularly enjoyed:

I learned that sprouted watermellon seeds are surprisingly tasty!

I have been **researching** nutrition, **devouring** (haha) every book about food I can find, and **listening** to podcasts constantly for the last two years or so, but I still felt like **I learned a ton** from this workshop. I had a blast **learning and lunching** with other health-conscious people. I hope to continue attending these types of events and sharing what I can with whoever wants to learn.
