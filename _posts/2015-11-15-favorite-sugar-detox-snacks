One of the hardest parts of your diet to "clean-up" is your snacking habits. Here are some great ideas to make that transition seamless.

**THE SNACKS**

1. Fruit

	I don't think I really need to explain anything here....

2. Olives

	Kalamata, black, green, pimento stuffed, lots of great options for different occasions! I enjoy them plain or in a tapenade with raw veggies.

3. Smoked oysters

	You either love them or you hate them!

4. Avocados

	They can be eaten plain with salt sprinkled on, made into guacamole and eaten with raw carrot sticks, or even mixed with bananas for a dairy and sugar free pudding!

	[Easy Dairy Free Chocolate Mousse Pudding](http://balancedbites.com/2013/01/easy-recipe-dairy-free-chocolate-mousse-pudding.html) is really more of a dessert than a snack, but hey, sometimes an after dinner treat is necessary!

5. Chia Pod:

	[This company](https://thechiaco.com/products/chia-pod) has a lot of great flavor options, and all of the varieties I have tried so far have been marvelous. 

	*Be careful to select flavors that do not have added sugar, such as banana or vanilla. Read the ingredient list to make sure.*

6. Bananas & Coconut Cream

	Or Apples & Coconut Cream, or both! Top with cinnamon for optimal flavor. :)

7. Kombucha Gummies

	Surprisingly yummy! I found a great recipe [here](http://paleoparents.com/featured/gelatin-jigglers-fruit-snacks-healthy-nourishing-gummies/).

8. Pumpkin Almond or Sunflower-Seed Butter

	I'm biased, but I think [my recipe](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/sugar-detox-friendly-pumpkin-almond-butter) is the best!
