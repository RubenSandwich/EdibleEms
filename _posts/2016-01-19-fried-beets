It's hard not to love beets when they are fried. Even my husband, who is a beet-hater, likes this recipe.The coconut oil brings out the **natural sweetness** of the beets and the crispy texture is surprisingly chip-like. A perfect go-to snack or even side dish to a meal!

	Ingredients:

* 4 whole medium sized beets

* 4 T coconut oil (butter works as well)

* Salt to taste

<br>

	Directions:

1. Peel beets and slice them as thinly as you can. If you have a mandolin slicer, now would be a great time to use it. 

2. Place half the coconut oil in a large frying pan and bring to a high heat. Once the pan is hot, carefully place as many beets as will fit onto the surface.

3. Fry the beets, flipping over after 4-5 minutes, for about 10-12 minutes total. This will vary depending on your stove, so you just have to carefully watch them. 

4. Once they are cooked and slightly crispy, the beets are ready. Transfer them to a plate to catch any drips and add the remaining beets to the pan, adding oil if needed. It may take 2-3 batches of frying to finish, depending on the size of your pan. (Cast iron pans typically hold a lot more than the average frying pan, unless you have a wok.)

5. Let the beets cool slightly before eating, as they will be extremely hot at first.
