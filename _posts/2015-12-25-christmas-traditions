*Making ornaments out of oranges definitely is going to be one of our new family Christmas traditions. They were so fun to make, and beautiful too!*

This year I have been pondering the subject of Christmas, its meaning, and the traditions surrounding it a bit more than usual. Perhaps this is because it is the first year it will have been just my husband and I to celebrate exactly how we want it. I am excited to **create our own traditions** that mesh our two backgrounds together!

Growing up my mom always made a traditional Norwegian fish called **Lutefisk,** which is cod preserved in lye. This is a very special dish that had to be preserved ahead of time to withstand the winter. As a child I did not like it at all (the fish resembles a jello-like texture), but now I am growing used to it and I more appreciate the specialness (is that a word?) or it rather than the taste. Anyway, Lutefisk is hard to find and even harder to make, so this year I decided to try **salt cod** which I figure is similar. I will report back on how it turns out!

*This is the salt cod I will be cooking for Christmas dinner.*

I will also be making traditional **Lefse,** which is basically a potato-pancake. I will be trying to make it without wheat flour, but instead using tapioca flour to make it healthier, so it *may* not turn out. I am so thankful for an easy-going husband who lets me experiment with meals!
