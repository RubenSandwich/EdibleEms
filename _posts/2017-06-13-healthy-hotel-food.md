During the past week on my trip to Stockholm, I wasn't actually that worried about food quality. The food in Sweden is way healthier than in the U.S. in general, and I was able to eat out a lot more than I usually do without feeling sick at all. However, as a general rule I try to limit my eating out either way as I tend to overeat when I do. Plus, a week of eating out for every meal would really add up and get expensive, so having even a couple of meals in my hotel room (or outside for a picnic!) saved a ton of money. 

<br>

**The One Fail**

I always like to experiment with differnet ways to eat healthy while traveling, and this time I got even more gutsy and tried to hard boil eggs in the hotel room by placing them in a cup and pouring boiling water from the hot watr heater over them. I thought it would be like hard boiling (or even just soft-boiling!) an egg, but it did NOT work that way. I wish I would have gotten a picture but no matter how many times I refilled the cup with boiling water, the eggs did NOT cook. I opened them and got egg all over the garbage can that I had (luckily!) placed underneath it. Wah-wah. :(

**Picnics**

We had one picnic for dinner this week. It was on our anniversary, actually. Since the food quality is better in Europe, I decided to try some brie, sourdough bread (which is technically fermented which makes it naturally gluten free!), and bites of salami, grapes, and cherry tomatoes. It was so refreshing and I had no issues with the dairy or the bread! It was wonderful and much more serene then going to a restaurant. The view was pretty great, too. :)

*Even included a dessert cake slice that we picked up at a local bakery! Not healthy, but your anniversary only comes once a year. :)*

**Snacks:**

These are the snacks I mainly focused on during our springtime [visit to Stockholm](http://edibleem.com/sweden-vlog). 

1. Grapes, apples, bananas, other fruit. Obvious, but always a great option. 

2. Granola bars - easy to bring, easy to pick up after you arrive.


<br>

**Easily eaten vegetables:**

1. Raw bell peppers - you can eat these just like apples. Just be careful not to spill the seeds, so you may want to eat over a plate or napkin. 

2. Broccoli - just eat it raw with some good dressing, or break it up into small pieces in a cup or bowl and pour boiling water over it. This will lightly cook the broccoli, making it even easier to digest. 

3. Grape tomatoes

**Proteins:**

1. Can of pre-cooked chickpeas - make sure to get a BPA free can, if possible. I ate mine with sea salt, broccoli, and olive oil and it was a great light lunch!

2. Jerky - easy to make yourself or you can find it in just about any store.

3. Peanut/almond/sunflower seed butter - great on it's own or on celery, apples, slices of Ezekiel bread, etc.

**Other, but still just as important:**

1. Olive oil! You can find tiny bottles of this just about anywhere.

2. Salt. Get some quality mineral-rich salt to put on your veggies. That way you are motivated to eat your veggies a bit more! ;) My salt here is also a souvenier because this is something that's way harder to find in the states.
