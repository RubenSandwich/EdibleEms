Ok, I know I started this website to share my easy recipes and tricks for quicker yet healthy meals for busy people. BUT I could not help sharing this recipe. Ruben taught me this recipe not long after we began dating when I wanted to try some traditional Romanian food that he was used to having growing up. It is definitely a team effort, so we have made it several times when we have wanted a cooking date.

We made it again the other night and I was reminded by how amazing and different it is from anything else we (and most Americans) usually make. I decided I had to share it, even if it is a little time consuming. It is still a really fun dish to make and I thought people might enjoy at least looking at pictures. We have made it for several friends and they have all raved about it (hopefully they were being sincere!). I do not tolerate dairy very well and usually refuse to eat it, but this dish is definitely worth an exception.

It always gets eaten up right away! Never any leftovers with this dish.

Now we also need to talk about this name. This dish is called Ursuleț (pronounced Urs-ul-lets), and it translates to “little bear” in Romanian. Ruben tells me there is absolutely no reason for this that he knows of and that is just what it is called. Little bear cornmeal balls…. Makes sense, right?

Ingredients:

* 2 cups water 

* 2 cups coconut milk, almond milk, or any other type of milk (or just use 4 cups water if you don’t have milk laying around)

* 1 cup polenta/cornmeal

* ¾ cup feta cheese (we used basically a whole 4 ounce feta cheese container)

* 1 Tablespoon olive oil, bacon fat, or butter

* Salt & pepper

Directions:

Pour water and milk (or just water if not adding milk) into a saucepan and heat to boiling.

Once boiling, add 1 cup polenta/cornmeal SLOWLY, while simultaneously whisking.

Turn heat to low and whisk/stir every 3-4 minutes (this is really important as the cornmeal will stick to bottom if you do not stir).

The cornmeal will take about 30 minutes to fully cook. This part is relatively tedious, but you have to make sure to keep watching it. I usually use this time to bounce between stirring the polenta and making a salad and/or protein to serve with it.

After the cornmeal is fully cooked (it should not be grainy at all, I suggest taste testing a bit to make sure), plop large spoonfulls of  the… dough?... onto a large cutting board. It will be thick like in the picture below. You may also want to wait a few minutes before beginning step 6 as the polenta will most likely be pretty hot.

Add a bit of feta cheese to the center of each spoonful laid out on the cutting board. I don’t really measure, just add enough for it to be nice and cheesy inside but not too much so that you can’t fit the cheese into the dough when making it into balls (see step 8).

Place a frying pan over medium heat with the olive oil, bacon fat, or butter so it will begin warming up while you finish making the cornmeal balls.

Use the spoon or your fingers to form the polenta around the feta to make it into round balls. This part is a bit messy. (See picture below)

Drop the balls into the pan and fry until golden brown (about 5 minutes).

As soon as they are fried, the Ursuleț are finally ready to be served!

Serve as a side (typically in Romania it is served with sausage, chicken, pork, or some type of meat), or as a main vegetarian dish with salad and another vegetable side.

If you try this, feel free to let me know what you thought of it! I am curious whether any other Americans like this recipe as much as I do.
