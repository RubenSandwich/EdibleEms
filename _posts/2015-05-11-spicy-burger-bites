There are pros and cons to living in an apartment, for sure.  I know I really appreciate not having to fix things that break or pay to replace anything. Not having a yard, though, is pretty sad for me. I would love to have my own little  **outdoor space,** maybe a small backyard in a city house with a couple **leafy trees** that block me from seeing anything else besides green…

Growing up my father would grill probably weekly, if not more often. As the days become warmer and summer grilling season is upon us, I kind of miss having <span style="font-size: 20px;">**casual burger nights with the family.**</span> If you’re in the same boat as me living in an apartment, then this recipe is for you. It will bring back the wonderful taste you remember. Though I can’t promise it will bring you the outdoors experience or (aparate) your family to you, sorry. I could if I would!

	Ingredients:

* 1 lb ground beef (preferably grass fed)

* ½ medium head broccoli

* 1 egg

* 2 cloves garlic

* 2 teaspoons red pepper flakes 

* Salt & pepper

* 1 tablespoon olive oil


<pre><code>Topping Suggestions:</pre></code>


* Tomatoes

* Lettuce

* Cheese (if you tolerate it)

* Caramelized onions   

<pre><code>Directions:</pre></code>

Cut of the broccoli florets from the stems as in the picture below and steam them for about 10 minutes, or until bright green and cooked through.

Put broccoli, garlic, egg, & spices in food processor and pulse until combined and crumbly, as in the picture below. Do not let it go long enough to become a puree, then the burgers will not stick together.

Combine with the ground beef and mix with your hands to make sure everything is evenly distributed.

Form mixture into small round burgers while the olive oil is heating over medium heat in a frying pan. You can also make these normal sized, they will just take longer to cook.

Cook the burgers for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until done. Making bigger burgers may double the cooking time.

I usually serve my burger bites in a lettuce wrap topped with tomato, caramelized onions, and a side of roasted potato wedges or homemade potato fries/chips.
