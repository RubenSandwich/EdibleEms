A lot of exciting things have been happening in my life lately that will cause a lot of (good) changes to Eat With Emily. Here are all the details:

<br>

**Announcement #1**

<br>

Last week I finally got to try out **Bipartisan Cafe** on NE Stark St in Portland. And just in time because **I AM MOVING TO PITTSBURGH!** That's right, Eat With Emily will be based in Pittsburgh starting in just one week! Well, maybe more than that, we'll see how well I can blog while driving across country....

Anyway, my incredibly smart and talented husband got a great opportunity in an awesome city, so we are packing up and moving in just 6 days!

**Announcement #2**

<br>

In addition to moving to the East Coast, I want to make another exciting announcement! Just recently, I was contacted by a startup called [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com), which is a neutral restaurant review website. This means that the company is not paid by the restaurants to give them reviews, but simply is trying to give people easy options for where the local people in each city like to eat. I love that they focus on **fostering community through food** and promote **eating at local places**!

Do any of you remember Urbanspoon? Well Zomato has merged the information from Urbanspoon after it shut down and has created a whole new foodie community. I am excited to become a part of it and have an excuse to experience different restaurants! **Expect more restaurant reviews from Eat With Emily in the future!**

I met the representative from Zomato at Bipartisan Cafe. As my time in Portland comes to a close, I have been trying to go to as many restaurants before I leave, so this was perfect timing to start my Zomato journey. Bipartisan Cafe was well worth the dwindling time that I now have. The pictures on the wall are various political posters from years ago, which gives the cafe quite a quirky feel. It reminds me of the **old Portland,** or what Portland used to be like before the rise of hipsterdom. I tried their **beef chili,** and it was homey and hearty and wonderful! The bowl is definitely way too much for one person though, warning.

*As a disclaimer, I do not receive any sort of compensation from Zomato or the restaurants for writing reviews. It is simply for fun, to check out new restaurants, and to connect with other foodies through my Eat With Emily community!*
