These are a bit of a labor of love (I’d classify this as a medium-difficulty recipe in terms of time and care needed), but they are so worth every moment!

*Ingredients:*


• ¼ cup avocado oil or lard (or some other mild, heat-resistant oil)


• 4 medium/large potatoes (or 8 small potatoes)


• Salt to taste (see directions)



*Directions:*


1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit. 


2. Peel the potatoes. I know, this takes forever and is not fun, but fries are just not good with the potato skins on. Period.


3. Spiralize the potatoes on blade A of [the spiralizer]. If you don’t have a spiralizer, you could alternatively use a [julienne peeler]. 


4. Sprinkle oil onto a baking sheet, spreading it out so that none of the fries get stuck to the pan. Melt it in the oven first if you need to. 


5. Place the potatoes on the pan and bake for ___ minutes.


6. Once the potatoes are cooked, you want to get them crispy. Melt ~2 T more of oil over medium-high heat in a large pan and add the curly fries (in batches if they won’t all fit at once). Stir frequently to prevent them from burning.


7. Once crispy and hot, take the potatoes out, wait a minute or two, and then enjoy them!
