A couple of weekends ago Ruben and I drove out to Sauvie’s Island, just a few miles outside of Portland, to pick peaches. I love visiting farms and am trying to learn to cook seasonally, plus this made for a really fun date!

We picked so many peaches that we knew there was no way we could eat them in time, so we decided to take on a new project and learn how to can. However, most recipes out there add a lot of sugar to the peaches – and peaches are already very sweet! 

Here is what we did instead:

1.	Boil the peaches for 1-2 minutes to get their skins soft & easy to peel. 

2.	Put the hot peaches in icewater to cool them off before removing the peels (maybe next time we will keep the skins and figure out some way to dehydrate them or use them somehow – this time we just threw them in the compost).

3.	Chop the peaches up and put them into glass mason jars (these are actually super hard to find with matching lids at places like goodwill, where you think would be perfect places to find them. I finally broke down and ordered some. They are pretty inexpensive on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DIZ1NO?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B001DIZ1NO&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20)). 

4. Add a couple teaspoons of honey, squeeze in lemon juice, and fill the jars the rest of the way with water. Leave about an inch wiggle room at the top.

5.	Making sure the mason jars are well sealed, put them in a large pot of boiling water with enough water to cover the tops of the jars. Boil for about 25 minutes then take them out and you are done!







Clearly I am not too precise with measurements, so feel free to tweak the recipe – add more sugar, etc, but the process of boiling should be followed in order to ensure the peaches will be preserved effectively.
