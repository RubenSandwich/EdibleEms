This is another one of those goals that I am a bit embarrassed about, as it is so simple to make, but it is something I have never done and needed to finally try! I am so glad I did too. This simple sauce is really going to **up the fancy factor** on any simple breakfast. Now I have something I can be proud to serve my in-laws! Gotta love those fancy foods that are actually a cinch to make.
