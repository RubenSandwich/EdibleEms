It is highly likely that during the **3 weeks on the 21-Day Sugar Detox** that your friends will want you to go out to eat with them, or your office will go out to eat, or you will be shopping and all of a sudden get really hungry and have an unplanned meal out. One of those situations may have applied to me in the last week.

<br>

**Here's what I did to stay 21DSD compliant:**

1. Order a curry. They are dairy free, often using coconut milk instead of dairy milk.

2. No drink. Water or plain coffee or tea are fine too. Save the fancy drinks for when you can make them yourself without all the extra ingredients!

3. Limit starches. As you can see from my plate, there is a LOT of rice in it. Next time I will ask for either no or less rice (it is ok for Level 1 of the detox), but this time I just ate about a half a cup and then saved the rest for leftovers. Easy!

<br>

**Not on a detox but want to stay on a stricter diet/health plan? Here are my suggestions:**

1. Drinks are a huge health hinderance. Get used to drinking plain tea and coffee if you want to order something. Pretty much any other drinks, even ones that sound healthy (like Ginger Ale) are often full of sugar. If you must go out for drinks, order a club soda (just carbonated water) and lime instead of a beer - your tummy will thank you later!

2. Stay away from anything fried and instead opt for soups, salads, grilled veggies/meat/fish. The oils they use in restaurants are no bueno for you. 

3. Go to Pho - everybody likes Pho! It is inexpensive, social, and one of those few things that are way better to go out to eat than to make yourself. 

**I hope those tips are helpful! Sometimes, even if you are on a super strict diet, you still want to (and should!) be social with your friends. I think you can be both healthy and have fun, just with a little extra planning. Happy Weekend everybody!**
