So, I came up with this great way to chop onions into perfect rings. You know how when you go to make **French Onion Soup** and you have to cut 6 onions into rings to caramelize? (Or does anybody else make French Onion Soup besides me?) Once you take off their shell and have exposed their round shape and slippery outside, the task of cutting rings becomes downright dangerous!

Here's a method I have been using that works for me:

<br>

**In three steps:**

1. Take off outer shell of onions

2. Slice a thin layer of the widest part of the onions off (not the smaller ends)

3. Lay onion on the freshly flattened side and cut cross sections into rings

*Be careful with that knife!*

In case you need an excuse to use onion rings (besides making **fried onion rings**), here's a basic recipe to get you started.

<br>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**French Onion Dinner Soup (Paleo and dairy-free)**</span>

	Ingredients:

* 1 leek

* 1 sweet onion

* 1 white onion

* 2 T butter, olive oil, or bacon fat

* 4-6 cups chicken broth (depending on how thin or thick you prefer for your soup)

* Any of all of the following (either fresh or dried) spices to taste: Rosemary, Oregano, and/or Thyme

* 1 bay leaf

* Salt & pepper

* Thinly sliced and cooked beef

<br>

	Directions:

1. Slice all three onions in rings, as shown in the video above. Warning: this part may make you cry.

2. Melt the butter, oil, or fat in a large stock pan and add the sliced onions once fully melted. Cook the onions on medium-low heat for 20-30 minutes, or until turned brown and soft.

3. Once the onions are cooked down to a mush, add the broth, salt & pepper, spices, and bay leaf. Turn heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.

4. After the soup is brought to a boil, turn heat back to low, prop a lid on the pot (making sure to leave it partially open), and let simmer for another 30 minutes or so.

5. Add the beef and let it warm in the soup for 4-5 minutes.

6. Turn the heat off, ladle soup into bowls, and enjoy!
