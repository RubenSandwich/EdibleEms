I have done a post on car trips, [HERE](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/travel-with-emily-cross-country-road-trip) but I thought this week that I would reflect a bit more about what I do to stay healthy, or in my case **mostly Paleo** while away from home.

*Anybody have any road trips planned for 2016 yet???*

<br>



**Here are my tips:**

1. Don't get a hotel. Look for an Airbnb with a kitchen instead. Pretty much every place I have stayed using that website has access to a kitchen. A shared kitchen is fine, as it allows for you to at least cook simple meals while there.

2. If you need to get a hotel, request for a mini-fridge (and, if possible, a microwave). Most hotels have that option but unfortunately you have to pay a bit more a night for that commodity. But, if it means you will eat out less, or not at all, then you will most likely actually be *saving* money.

In case you need some inspiration, here is what I did on my last overnight stay at an Airbnb house.

<br>

	Dinner

For dinner we brought chicken that had been in our freezer that we set in a small cooler to thaw during the day. We baked the chicken thighs, along with carrots, onions, fresh rosemary at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. We ate this with some leftover rice that we brought and re-heated, although it would have been just as easy to chop up potatoes and bake them with everything else. One pot, very few ingredients, and ridiculously easy!

*I thought about bringing this as an easy side dish, but we had enough food already. [Pre-jarred roasted bell peppers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CNVJJEC?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00CNVJJEC&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) would make an awesome easy side dish or soup to bring anywhere though!*

<br>

	Breakfast

Breakfast is the easiest, I think. Eggs travel pretty well in a glass jar and are quick and easy to cook. We fried eggs in the same pan as potatoes and heated up some leftover roasted cauliflower that I brought in a tupperware. Since we were on vacation, I also brought some smoked salmon to eat with our eggs as a special treat.

*Bringing my own bagged tea was something I am so glad I remembered. Nearly every place serves crappy coffee, so it is nice to have an alternative! One of my favorites is this [Smith Tea Peppermint](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L48PNA?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B004L48PNA&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) flavor.*

<br>

	Lunch

Usually this is the meal I will go out for, as it is fun and cheaper than dinner and a treat since my lunches during the week are usually pretty boring. But, if we are staying for an extended period of time, usually I will have a few lunches at the hotel. **Leftovers from dinner** the night before is always an easy option. **Salads** are great too if you bring salad mixes (Trader Joe's has some good ones) and canned chicken, salmon, or tuna. Add fruit that travels well (apples, bananas, oranges, etc) and you've got a great no cook meal! 

<br>

	Dessert

I bought dessert. I'll be honest, I am not a great baker to begin with and the thought of making something in a kitchen that I am unfamiliar with was too much. 

So, I bought this super clean brand called [Hail Merry](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B04FOTC?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00B04FOTC&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) that I HIGHLY recommend. It has no refined sugar, dairy, or gluten yet tastes like heaven! My only regret is that I only bought one for Ruben & I to share and I wish I would have had my own....

But, I could just have easily have made my own cookies beforehand and simply brought them in a tupperware, too.

	Returning Home

You know how when you return home from a vacation and feel icky for eating badly (although that won't happen if you do the tips suggested above!) and then have nothing in the house? 

Freezer meals and canned protein saved the day for me! As soon as I got home, I took out a jar of [chili](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/secret-ingredient-chili) that I had saved from the last time I made chili. We had this for dinner and for lunch I opened a few cans of tuna and we made [this recipe](http://nomnompaleo.com/post/91332244628/spicy-tuna-cakes) from the Nom Nom Paleo website. I didn't have a jalape√±o but that is ok, I just used red pepper flakes instead! :)
