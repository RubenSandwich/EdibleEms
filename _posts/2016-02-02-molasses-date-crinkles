When I went to Ecuador last fall, they served a dessert that I went crazy over! I did not catch the name for it, but it was basically dates mixed with real molasses and coconut meat, and it was amazing!

I liked it because it was not too sweet, as many American desserts tend to be. I liked it so much, in fact, that I recreated my own version of it, but with coconut flakes instead of the meat, as I find them easier to find and also cheaper.

	Ingredients:

* 12 dates

* 1 & 1/2 T molasses

* About 2 T coconut flakes, unsweetened

<br>

	Directions:

1. Roughly chop the dates (if the dates have pits, remove those first). This will make it easier to blend, as dates are very sticky.

2. Blend the dates and molasses in a [food processor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AXM4SB6?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B01AXM4SB6&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) until smooth. It may take a few minutes, so be patient. Be sure to scrape the edges of the food processor every 30 seconds or so to make sure all of the pieces are incorporated. 

3. While the dates are blending, spread the coconut flakes on a plate.

4. Form the mixture into small balls and roll onto the coconut flakes as you press them into flat cookie shapes, as shown in the pictures. You can leave them in balls if you wish, but I like forming them into small bite sized cookie shapes.

5. Eat and enjoy! No baking required!
