Directions:

1. Heat the olive oil over medium heat on a frying pan.

2. While the oil is heating, roughly chop or spiralize the cabbage and onion and place into the pan once finished. 

3. If the chorizo is uncooked, put it in a separate frying pan with a bit more oil until cooked. Cool and chop into slices. If it is already cooked, then chop it and set it aside.

4. Chop the garlic and add to the pan along with the cooked chorizo and saute for 3-4 minutes. 

5. Add olives and adjust seasons right before serving.
