Now that I’ve finished writing [our love story](http://edibleem.com/how-he-unintentionally-had-me-hooked), I’ve been feeling like something is missing on this blog. I like writing about things that are important to me, and my marriage is obviously one of those things! 

So, I’ve decided to start a new series based on a new little rule we implemented in our house about 6 months ago. 

The rule is this: no matter what, each and every week R and I have to set aside time for one date. This rule has some sub-rules, too:

* The date cannot be work or housework related at all

* It does not have to be for more than an hour if we are really busy, but it has to be one-on-one time

* We have to do this every single week, no matter what

Instigating this practice has been SO helpful in our marriage and communication. Plus, it’s been fun! 

Now I am starting to record these in hopes that it will be an inspiration to those who want to be more intentional in their relationships - remember this does not have to be just for couples, but can be a great rule for close friends and family members. If you have any ideas for fun date nights and friend-date nights, please comment below!

For our first date that I am recording, we spent a cold night inside at a low-profile museum. It’s called [The Frick], and it is a small campus of buildings donated from a wealthy art collector from Pittsburgh. 

It includes a gorgeous art museum:

An old car museum:

And even a place to get tea! We unfortunately went in the evening when the tea shop was closed so we will have to come back for a future date. 


I asked Ruben to get a picture of me in my favorite room and this is what I got:

Let’s just say he’s not really a picture person.

Oh and a bookstore! Saw this book and it cracked me up, especially since we went there on a date ;)

So that was our first date that I am recording and hopefully there will be many more to come! Give me all your suggestions for more dates!
