A year had gone by and I had not yet met his family. 




At first, it seemed a bit odd but after Ruben repeating that he just was not close with his family and that they tended to be harsh and judgemental I stopped thinking too much about it.




Holidays passed and we went our separate ways, me to spend them with my family and he for his. Of course he went over to his family’s house way more than I went to mine considering they lived closeby, so every holiday we went our separate ways.




Until Year 2. 




The Thanksgiving Holiday has always been my parents’ escape together as it is their anniversary weekend and this particular year I ended up with exams the next week and nobody to spend the holiday with.




I guess after a year of dating Ruben’s parents had also begun to ask him about me and seemed interested in meeting me. His relationship with his parents had begun to improve at that point after a few rough years, so Ruben thought this may be the time to finally introduce me. 




After months of curiosity swelling up in my I suddenly became very nervous. Then I convinced myself that, “of course they will like me” and that all I had to do was smile and bring a stunning pecan pie and my work would be done. 




Boy was I wrong. (Long term at least.)




But for now, while our relationship was young, the parents did seem to like me. I went to dinner at their house, stayed for hours afterward playing games, accidently flung cabbage off the tongs into Ruben’s dad’s face (no I did not make that up, that actually happened), and only hyperventilated one time (I’m pretty sure nobody noticed). The hardest part was anticipation and that was finally over.




For now, I could totally see myself fitting into Ruben’s family and this time made me ever so slightly consider our future together as a possible married couple.
