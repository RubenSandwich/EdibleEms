Happy New Year! After the holidays and all the indulgences that come along with them, I am always looking for fresh new healthy recipes to try come January. Here is an easy, no-bake snack I created that is sure to set you on the track toward health success this year! They have no added sweeteners but between the natural sugar from the fruit and the cinnamon you won't miss anything.

	Ingredients:

* 1 cup whole almonds

* 1/2 cup raisins (or any other dried fruit)

* 1/2 cup shredded coconut flakes

* 1 T honey

* 1 tsp cinnamon

<br>

	Directions:

1. Soak almonds in water for a minimum of 4 hours and up to 24 hours, whichever length of time is most convenient for you. Do not skip this step, as the almonds will not bind with the rest of the ingredients if they are not soaked first!

2. Drain the almonds and place in a food processor along the rest of the ingredients. Blend until the ingredients are mixed an no big pieces remain.

3. Lay parchment paper on an 8x8 baking dish and spread the almond mixture evenly across the dish. Let harden in refrigerator for about 1 hour before cutting into bars of desired size and eating. The bars can be stored in the fridge for up to 10 days.
