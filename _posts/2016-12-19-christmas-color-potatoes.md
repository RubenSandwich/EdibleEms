Not at all the traditional Christmas side dish, this mixture of spice and starch is perfect for those who are bored with the usual. Sure, have all the regular Christmas dishes at your table this year, but maybe add this one if you want to impress someone without a lot of extra effort. ;)

*Ingredients:* 

* 5-6 small red potatoes

* 1 jalapeno

* 2 T grass fed butter, pastured lard, or avocado oil (may need more if the potatoes start sticking to the pan)

* Salt & pepper to taste

<br>

*Directions:* 

1. Slice red potatoes into discs. Leave the skin on for the color.

2. Slice the jalapeno into discs as well, using a spoon to take out the seeds out as you go. 

3. Melt the butter or pour the avocado oil into a cast iron skillet or large frying pan over medium-low heat. Once it is melted, add the potatoes and jalapenos at the same time. Season with salt and pepper. 

4. Leave the potatoes and jalapeno to cook, stirring every 4-5 minutes or so. They will take quite a while to cook, but you can leave them going while preparing other dishes at the same time. Be sure to stir every so often, though, otherwise they will burn.

5. After about 25-30 minutes, the potatoes should be cooked and the jalapenos will be soft and way less spicy. Season again with salt and pepper to taste, and serve up!
