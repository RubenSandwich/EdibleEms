Outline:

Starts with a healthy dinner 

Meetings/chores/activities after dinner - I don't do well with exercise between dinner and bed except for light yoga. 

Active relaxation: 

Take dog outside one last time while soaking in my surroundings, noticing the moon. 

Brew a cup of loose leaf tea - the ritual 

Stretches while tea cools down.

Change out pillowcase. 

Not anything crazy - reading ~30 minutes to 1 hour before turning lamp off and falling asleep.
