Last week I had one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life. I saw a world I have never seen - starting in the heart of Ecuador, it's capitol city of Quito, then traveling through **the Andes Mountains** and on to the north coast right near the Columbia border.

**I was surprised about how much I learned about the Ecuadorian culture through its food.** The whole structure of their day is different, and this is reflected in how meals are served. Not only do they take the time to sit down, chew their food, and drink a cup of **café** (each meal was a minimum of 1 hour long), but the meals were served in entirely different proportions throughout the day.

*Fruit bigger than my head!*

*Fresh fruit was abundant all over Ecuador, and I had so much fun drinking fresh coconut water out of a real coconut picked minutes earlier!*

<br>

The daily eating schedule tends to be as follows:

* Morning  - A smaller, but not rushed meal. ALWAYS served with a cup of café. I loved not having to rush in the morning - no matter how much work we had to do, we always took time to **sit down and eat.** And guess what? We were pretty productive and got a lot of work done! Crazy!

* Lunch - The biggest meal of the day! Most of the work is done in the early morning when the weather is cooler, then lunch is a little longer and afterwards is a **Siesta.** This is the biggest difference I noticed between our cultures. This pattern was nice not just to **escape the heat,** but also because it allowed for **more social time during the day.** 

* Dinner - A smaller, simple, and vegetable focused meal. Usually later in the evening due to working late after the Siesta. A lot of people would still have coffee with dinner, which I could not even believe!

*I would give anything to be back there napping in this hammock right now!*

**What I learned about health through the Ecuadorian food culture:**

*1. Longer time to eat* = less stomachaches, more time spent with people. That advice we always hear nutritionists telling us about taking time to sit, chew, and eat your food....well, they may be on to something! 

*2. Three square meals a day & no snacking actually works!* Sitting down and having three larger meals made it so that I was not hungry throughout the day. I hate having to stop and snack every few hours, which is a habit I got into at my desk job. This pattern was a lot easier and made me stop obsessing about eating and able to focus on working throughout the day.

*3. It takes time to prepare a quality meal.* This was some of the best food I have had, and no doubt it was difficult to make. Even the coconut milk and meat was taken out of a coconut that our friend broke open for our meal. I do not know if it was that homemade food is SO much better or if it was the love she poured into making our food, but it seemed to taste way better than anything you can get at a restaurant. 

*4. Small desserts satisfy. Also, fruit counts a dessert!* After a few days of not having sweets, I found my cravings went away and even fruit seemed like such a treat. This is one of the reasons why I am inspired to do a [21-Day Sugar Detox](http://balancedbites.com/21dsd) starting in November (stay tuned for updates on the blog as I go through the detox!).

*This was by far my favorite dessert - a **coco** (which means coconut, NOT chocolate I found out), date, and molasses roll. It was so sweet with all natural sweeteners too!*


<br>

**Some examples of meals we had:**

*Most meals were extremely starch-heavy. Typically served was one type of protein, most commonly **pescado** (fish) or **pollo** (chicken), plantains (cooked in various different methods), and rice. Sometimes other veggies and fruit were also served.*

*A meal we had on our last day on the way back to Quito. Smashed chicken, home cut potato fries, marinated cucumber salad, and of course rice.*

<br>

*We had a LOT of fish which is pretty common on the coast, but shellfish is a special treat. One of the men in the community that we stayed in caught a crab and lobster and decided to give them to our group. It was so kind and such a treat! In case you were wondering, yes it tasted amazing.* :)

*Fruit juice (jugo) was served at nearly every meal, which was definitely not something I knew was so common. One day the restaurant owner asked if we wanted Coke instead of juice, to which we said "definitely not!"*

*Perhaps the most exotic meal I had was a whole fried Tilapia fish! I ate most of it, including the skin, cheek meat (one of my fellow travelers suggested it and she was right that it was worth the hard work digging for!), and an eyeball! My husband ate the other eyeball. :P*

<br>

*And of course I had to buy some real, Ecuadorian chocolate that I actually found at the airport on the way home. We didn't have much time for shopping, so I only bought one for me... Sorry, no more left to share!*

**Coming Soon:** 

Look for my re-creations! One of my favorite meals was smashed and fried plantains, formed into tiny cups and filled with fish and green chili sauce. Unfortunately I was not able to snap a picture of the meal, but the image is burned into my head and I will be working to re-create it in the next few weeks!
