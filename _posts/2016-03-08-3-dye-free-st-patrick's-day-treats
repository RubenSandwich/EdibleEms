This time of year everything is turning green. It has always been ironic to me that we celebrate St. Patrick’s Day by wearing and baking/cooking green things, as it is perfect for the season we are jumping into: spring!

**Sunbutter Cookies**

This is the most amazing secret ever. When you bake with sun butter it turns green! See? I tried it out myself!

If you want to try the magic, here's the explanation on the sun butter brand website:

**Avocado Mousse**

Ok, the end result isn’t green, but it’s made out of avocados so it counts right? Any excuse for avocado mousse!

**Spinach smoothie**

You don’t really need a recipe for this, but I’ll link to a good one I like. If you aren’t a recipe-following person, then here are some ingredient ideas with no particular proportions.

* Spinach (for “greenness” and also for some raw veggie power!)

* Kale

* Banana (adds lots of sweetness and no color)

* Frozen pineapple

* Frozen blueberries (will darken a bit, but makes it so tasty!) 

* Frozen mango

* Coconut milk

* Almond milk

* Coconut cream

* Almond butter (you’d be surprised!)

* Lemon juice

And just in case you want a recipe, this is one I recommend:
