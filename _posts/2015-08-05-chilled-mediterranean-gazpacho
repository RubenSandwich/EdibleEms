A perfect summer combination using **in season** foods and a **no cook** method (because who wants to turn on the stove when it is 90 degrees out?).

	Ingredients:

	Directions:

1. Peel and chop the cucumber and roughly chop the tomatoes.

2. Add the tomatoes along with the cucumber and broth to a food processor. Add a pinch of salt & pepper and blend thoroughly (2-3 minutes, depending on how high quality your food processor is).

3. Once the soup is completely blended and free of chunks, pour it into bowls.Drizzle the olive oil on top to add flavor and make your soup into a beautiful display of food artwork. 

4. Add optional toppings - I suggest fresh basil and olives, as well as feta cheese if you can tolerate dairy.
