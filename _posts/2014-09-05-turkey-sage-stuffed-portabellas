I believe sage is a spectacular spice that is often forgotten and underappreciated. It has a bit of a unique flavor so it cannot simply be added to any dish, but it goes perfectly in in this recipe and makes for a much nicer presentation. This recipe also uses ground chicken. What I love about ground meat is that it is so versatile – see print in Italics for suggestions of how to make this recipe stretch for two meals.

This dish is incredibly simple. First, cook the meat in olive or coconut oil and salt and pepper.

Then add tomato sauce and cook for a few minutes.

Spray a baking dish with olive oil or grease it with butter.

Bake at 375 degrees for about 10 minutes.

Optional: While baking, sautee up some yellow squash with any leftover tomato sauce as a side. Or make a green salad or zucchini noodles - this recipe pairs well with pretty much anything!

Top with sage, and you're done!

Ingredients:

* 1/2 lb ground chicken or turkey (opt. use 1 lb and have leftovers for breakfast the next day)

* 1 T Olive oil, coconut oil, or butter 

* 4 portabella mushroom caps, stems removed

* ¼ cup tomato sauce, preferably homemade* (Use1/2 cup if making extra)

* Salt & pepper

* Fresh sage

Directions:

1.	Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2.	Cook the chicken or turkey in a sauté pan over medium heat with olive oil, coconut oil, or butter. 
3.	When the chicken has cooked, turn the heat to low and add the salt, pepper, and tomato sauce. Cook for 2 or 3 more minutes on low so that the flavors can mix a bit.
4.	While chicken is cooking, wash the mushrooms and grease a baking pan or dish. Set the mushrooms on the dish and fill with the chicken and tomato mixture once it is finished. If using 1lb of chicken, set aside half of the mixture after the tomatoes are cooked in and save as a breakfast hash for the following day(s).
5.	Bake for about 10 minutes, or until mushrooms are cooked through
6.	Top with fresh sage and serve immediately.


Notes:

* I used [this](http://wellnessmama.com/8907/pasta-sauce/) recipe for the tomato sauce, which was very flavorful.

* Pairs well with a green salad, yellow squash, or zucchini noodles

* Can also substitute chopped fresh tomatoes or tomato paste
