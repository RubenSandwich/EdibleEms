We started doing this rotation thing where every week we switch who picks the dates. I think we've been trying to one-up each other, because our last few dates have been incredible!

My turn to pick was the week before last and I found this fun-looking Strawberry Festival in Smicksberg, PA (about an hour outside of Pittsburgh) to go to.

It definitely didn't end up being too much about strawberries, but it was fun nonetheless. 

Highlights for us were: seeing Amish people for the first time (and wow do their horses and buggys go surprisingly fast!) and visiting [Windgate Winery](http://www.windgatevineyards.com/)!
