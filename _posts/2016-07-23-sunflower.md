**Did you miss the first part of the story? Read [part 1](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/ruben-emily-1) and [part 2](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/letters-from-shepherd) before you read this post. Or not. It's still a good story. :)**

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<br>

When Shepherd (why no, his real name is not Shepherd - read why he has that nickname [here](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/ruben-emily-1)) asked me to the staff banquet (affectionately called Stanquet by the camp staffers), I was STILL so unsure of whether or not he was truly interested in my romantically. Sounds so crazy now, but I need things to be stated outright, black and white. I guess that is the engineer in me….

<br>

Anyway, I knew we were going together and anxiously awaited that evening all week. On Saturday morning, we said goodbye to our final batch of campers and held our very last staff meeting of the summer. That evening was the night of the staff banquet.

<br>

All throughout the meeting we were eyeing each other (like middle schoolers, I know. So immature). As soon as the meeting got over, Shepherd practically ran to my side, which I was so thankful for. I was incredibly shy at that point in my life and wanted so badly to speak to this guy at every second possible but just couldn’t bring myself to initiate anything. Don’t worry, I have changed a lot. :)

<br>

**What he asked, though, took me off guard so completely.**

<br>

Now this is one of the things I love about my husband: his resourcefulness, creativity, and magical ability to make the day flow in the moment with little or no planning.

<br>

Here was the surprise: Shepherd had been spending all of his free time throughout the summer building a sailboat! No, not from scratch, but pretty nearly. He had found an abandoned and utterly broken sailboat in the forest and used any tools and materials he could find to restore it back to life.

<br>

**Today, he wanted to take me out on the lake on his sailboat.**

<br>

What was even better than being asked to a large social event was being asked to spend an entire afternoon with this man I had been craving to see all summer.

<br>

<div style="color:blue;">And honestly, this afternoon is one of my fondest memories with Ruben.</div>

<br>

We spent nearly 3 hours sailing around the lake, finally conversing in person and tying up all loose ends that we could not explain through paper.

<br>

This was of course after we launched the boat only to find that we had forgotten oars! Shepherd heroically jumped into the water and pulled me in the sailboat back to shore to grab oars! Classic first date nerves. :)

<br>

It was wonderful, a bit scary, and… not enough time! At the end of the night and the next day while getting ready to leave camp, I made sure Shepherd promised to keep in contact with me after camp and hoped that we would meet again after moving back to Portland.
