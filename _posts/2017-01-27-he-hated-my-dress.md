**Becoming Facebook Official**


After the [last part of our story](http://edibleem.com/what-happened-on-christmas) we needed a pick-me-up and decided to spend an afternoon getting fun pictures taken to celebrate and enjoy our engagement period.


Plus, we needed some photos to go with our wedding announcement on Facebook! These things are important! 


**Engagement Photo Mistake**


We had a bit of a rough start to this romantic day, however.


As soon as I arrived to Ruben’s house so we could carpool to a nearby park for the photo shoot, I could tell he wanted to tell me something. We got ready to go and he said something about me having time to change. Change my clothes? I was so confused. “No, I am already dressed.” I said, and then realized why he looked uncomfortable.


“Oh you’re wearing that to our engagement pictures?” he asked. Wrong question. I was wearing a nice (I thought), wintery white sweaterdress that was so cozy and cute (I still think it is cute!). Unfortunately since then I have thrown it away and haven’t gotten a good picture of it, but you can see a bit of it in the picture below.

I was so hurt and confused but I obviously felt way too self-conscious to wear the dress now. I had come early so we could hang out but immediately left (I’ll admit, in a bit of a huff), and drove the 30 minutes back home, then 30 minutes back to Ruben’s. The whole time I was fuming and got angrier as I sat in traffic, angry that Ruben “made me” waste so much time, gas, and worry. 


**Do Over** 


Ruben of course had realized as soon as he said that comment that it was not a kind way to say that he didn’t like my dress. We have since worked out that it is appropriate on some occassions to make sure the other knows what we like and don’t like, but NOT right before we go out somewhere. No problems since this occassion, but it was a memorable one! Luckily I picked out just as cute of a dress and our photos turned out great! It was such a fun afternoon once we both calmed down and I loved being cheesy and posing in the beautiful park with my soon-to-be husband all afternoon.
