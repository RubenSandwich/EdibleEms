**At-Home Mindfulness Practices**


By now, everyone has at least hear the term “mindfulness” and knows generally what it means. Mindfulness is basically just awareness. Being in tune with how you feel, what is going on around you, and not letting time pass you by helps reduce stress, increase happiness, and minimize the anxieties of life...

But this is still a pretty vague idea. What does mindfulness look like in one’s everyday life? How exactly does one begin to be mindful?

Basic Awareness Exercise: A great way to get started implementing mindfulness into your everyday life is through a simple awareness exercise. Start by finding a quiet space and getting as comfortable as you can. Do whatever your body feels best doing, whether it be sitting on a mat or cushion, laying down, or even sitting in a chair with your eyes closed. 
Think about your day and just allow whatever thoughts that are most prominent come to the forefront. What is dominating your thoughts? Notice the thoughts that are in your head, but don’t judge, just observe.
