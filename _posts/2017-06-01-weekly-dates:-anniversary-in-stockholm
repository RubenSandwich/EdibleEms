Although it was mainly for work, we got to have a few great opportunities to sightsee. On our anniversary, we decided to forgo going out to eat and to instead have a quiet picnic at a viewpoint overlooking Stockholm. This place was known to have the best views of the city and I can tell you that although that didn't show up from the pictures, that was definitely true!

To eat, we got some fresh sourdough bread, brie as a treat (no we cannot eat dairy typically but had absolutely no problem with this cheese! Not surprising as food quality is much better in Europe.), cherry tomatoes, grapes, and carrot cake for dessert. It was the perfect evening, just enjoying being together in a beautiful place.

And now, instead of showing tons of pictures, here is a vlog from our trip!
