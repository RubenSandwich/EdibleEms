Salmon is pretty hard to mess up. It is a fatty, meaty fish that even fish-haters tend to like. Try to hate it when it is covered in [clean mayonnaise](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZWKI0HI?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00ZWKI0HI&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) and fresh herbs!

I suggest **pairing with roasted potatoes and any roasted veggies** to make it into a full meal. 

This is a filling **21-Day Sugar Detox friendly** meal that won't make you feel like you are on a diet.

	Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and sprinkle olive or coconut oil into a small baking pan.

2. Make the sauce: Chop the dill and slice the green onions into small rings. Mix mayonnaise with dill, green onions, juice from the lemon, and salt & pepper. Squeeze out as much juice from the lemon as possible.

3. Spread the sauce over the fillets and place them in the prepared baking pan.

4. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the salmon is clear and spongy. If you are unsure about whether or not the salmon is completely cooked, there is no shame in poking it open a bit with a fork or a butter knife to see the inside. 

5. Top with more fresh dill before serving.
