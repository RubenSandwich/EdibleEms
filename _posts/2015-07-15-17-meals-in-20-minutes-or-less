Beginning last week, I started working in Construction and will be there for the next several months. The field of construction is notorious for long hours and weird shifts, particularly in the summer.

<span style="font-size: 20px;">This calls for quick meals, shortcuts, and cheats.</span>

For this reason, I created a post of my quickest, easiest, and fastest recipes really as a resource for myself and my husband to get through the construction season, but also for anyone else who is busy and wants real, healthy food despite a lack of time to prepare it.

These are recipes I can easily whip up while dead tired. (Or that I can point my husband to so he can make them for me. Either way.)

I am determined to stay as healthy as I can this summer and not use business as an excuse to eat bad. Keep me accountable people!

<div style="color: blue;">1.	Broiled salmon or tilapia with rice and any quick-to-cook veggies</div> (Gluten-free and Dairy free)



Fish in general is very quick to cook, quicker than any other protein except eggs. Put some **healthy fat** (butter, coconut butter, olive oil) and spices (and always salt & pepper!) on the top and broil in the oven for 10 minutes or so, and you’re done! Some of the spices I suggest for fish include:

* Rosemary

* Turmeric

* Cumin

* Saffron

* Fresh herbs

These are my favorites but there really are infinite possibilities. 

To make it even quicker I set up my **rice cooker** to cook the rice for me and in a pinch I will even use **frozen veggies** to cut prep time down even more.

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">2.	My “[Quick Stir Fry](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/quick-stir-fry)"</div> (Paleo-friendly)

Or really any stir fry is quick to make, so long as you do not go too crazy adding tons of different veggies you need to chop. Two or three veggies is perfectly fine, and as I said before frozen or pre-chopped works just as fine if you are in a hurry. If you want an **easy recipe** to follow, try my Quick Stir Fry [HERE](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/quick-stir-fry).

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">3.	Hot dogs with sauerkraut, avocado, & clean potato chips</div> (Paleo-friendly)

Embarrassing, but yes I do use hot dogs for dinner every so often. Pair it with **chopped avocado** and **healthy potato chips** (homemade or otherwise – [HERE](http://www.bouldercanyonfoods.com) is a brand that is absolutely clean and can be found at Fred Meyer), and this is also a **no cook** meal!

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">4.	Crockpot pulled pork</div> (Paleo-friendly)

Pulled pork is quick to prepare & can cook for 10 hours! This is great because by the time you commute to work and account for lunch break, most peoples' days are actually closer to 10 hours than 8. Most crockpot recipes call for 6-8 hours of cooking time, which for me is impossible because **my working days are just not that flexible**. For this reason, I love pulled pork and prepare it fairly regularly. [HERE](http://civilizedcavemancooking.com/recipes/pork/crockpot-pulled-pork/) is a typical recipe that I will use. 

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">5.	Roast chicken</div> (Paleo-friendly)

Ok, this is not quick in overall time, but it is effortless in preparation and lasts the whole week! (see [my recipe](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/crockpot-balsamic-and-bell-pepper-chicken) for a crockpot version).

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">6.	Shrimp</div> (Can be made Paleo-friendly, Dairy free, and Pescitarian)


Shrimp cooks so quickly and also thaws in no time, which is useful for me because I nearly always forget to take out meat from the freezer ahead of time. It can also be the main part of many different types of dishes, including:

* Stir frys

* Added into soups (if you can find a clean pre-made soup, that is great too!)

* Combined with avocado to make a dinner salad

* Alone, cooked with lemon and served with a side salad and rice

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">7.	"Hash"</div> (Paleo-friendly) 

Take ground meat of any kind and sauté up **in this order:** 

* Onions 

* Garlic 

* Root vegetables (turnips, beets, potatoes, etc.)

* Leafy greens 

Sometime, I even like to add a runny fried egg on top, as in the picture below.

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">8.	Lettuce wraps</div> (Can be made Paleo-friendly, Vegetarian, and Vegan)

I like to stuff lettuce leaves with ground meat because it just cooks so quickly! You can also try beans, cubed chicken, or mushrooms for **vegetarian options.** Add in some shredded carrots, onions, and other veggies to make it more filling. Spread salsa on top for more flavor, if desired.

I often pack these wraps in tupperware for portable lunches as well, as you can see in the picture below.



![IMG_0257.JPG](/content/IMG_0257-JPG.jpg)





<br>

<div style="color: blue;">9.	Sliders</div> (Paleo-friendly)

Sliders cook quickly even compared to burgers since they are so much smaller ([my recipe](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/spicy-burger-bites) for **broccoli burgers** can be made into sliders, burgers, or even a hash)

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">10. Frittata</div> (Paleo-friendly and Vegetarian)

*Eggs + Whatever Vegetables You Have + Spices = 1 Pot Dinner* 

I like to sautee the veggies first in a cast iron skillet, then add scrambled eggs & turn the heat off. Let sit for a few minutes for the edges to get crispy, then **bake at 400 for 10-15 minutes** or so. If you are not vegetarian, you can also add bacon, ground meat, or any type of sausage (proscuitto is also great in frittatas).

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">11.	Skewers</div> (All Paleo-friendly)

Chopping meat and veggies into bite-sized pieces helps them cook up very quickly. Plus it makes for a fun and casual meal. 	

Combination Ideas: 

* Pineapple & ham

* Chicken or steak w/onions & bell peppers

* Shrimp with lemon juice

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">12.	Breakfast for dinner</div> (Can be made Paleo-friendly, Vegetarian)

Nothing cooks up quicker than eggs & bacon! Try carrot or zucchini pancakes as a fun way to **get your veggies in** (great recipe [HERE](http://balancedbites.com/2011/02/easy-recipe-grain-free-zucchini-pancakes.html))

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">13.	Steak w/steamed vegetables</div>  (Paleo-friendly)

Not only does **beef tip steak** cook quickly, it is super filling and surprisingly cheap. Add a side of steamed vegetables and  mashed potatoes and you’ve got a **near-instant** home-y meal. Or mix it all together and add some **fish sauce** to make it into a stir fry as shown in the picture below.

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">14.	Soups</div> (Can be made Paleo-friendly, Vegan or Vegetarian)

Throw any leftover veggies in with meat or beans and spices and you have got a meal. 

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">15.	My Surf & Turf Salad!</div> (Paleo-friendly)

Definitely a staple in my house -  I probably make this at least once a week. Find the recipe [HERE](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/salad-season-surf-turf-salad).



![IMG_1390.JPG](/content/IMG_1390-JPG.jpg)



<br>

<div style="color: blue;">16. Salmon or Tuna Burgers</div> (Paleo-friendly, Pescitarian, and Dairy-free)

These cook up so quickly and **reheat** really well the next day. This is a great recipe [HERE](http://balancedbites.com/2010/12/easy-recipe-grain-free-salmon-cakes.html).

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">17.	 Freezer meals!</div>

<br>

No, not that store bought garbage. **Homemade** freezer meals! Whenever I make some meal that is potentially freezable, such as:

* Meatballs

* Pre-cooked chicken

* Chili

I simply make extra and freeze it! This creates an **instant meal** that I just need to thaw ahead of time with **no extra work.**

<br>
