My main takeaway from this past family vacation in Northern Arizona (Vlog to follow): Cook dinners. You are there for at most a week, typically. So go out half the time and cook some meals at your apartment, hotel, condo, etc. You can buy small sizes of olive oil and just enough ingredients for the meals you make. It's easy, saves money, and is way healthier!

**Special Occasions**

The week we were all free happened to be my mom’s birthday week, so on Tuesday night we had to of course have cake! I’m not a great baker to begin with and I find it particularly stressful while I’m not at home with all my kitchen tools. So, I found this amazing cake mix at Whole Foods and everyone LOVED it. I couldn’t believe how great it tasted and how good I felt after eating it. No sugar high or crazy cravings after the typical birthday cake. It’s made of almond and coconut flour, as well as coconut sugar, so it is higher protein and lower carb and sugar.

**Dinners**

I made Thai peanut chicken and people loved it. All you need to do is grab some premade peanut satay sauce (no need to look for perfect ingredients, they don’t really exist unless you are making it from scratch yourself), rice noodles, chicken, and some fresh basil and limes for extra flavor. 


**Breakfasts**

I also made fresh fried eggs every morning, which takes barely any time at all. To go with this, I sautéed brussel sprouts and fried up potatoes that I baked the day after we arrived.

**Lunches**

Lunch typically consisted either of leftovers, my favorite [picnic spread](), a few cafes, and an easy tuna salad. When I wanted to make a real hearty meal, I made turkey burgers with a cream of asparagus soup (using the leftover asparagus from dinner the night before). Stick with basic foods everyone loves and don’t make it too complicated when you’re busy sight-seeing. ☺

**People Will Help You**

To help spread the workload around, I asked my parents to clean up and do dishes for the meals that I made. Grab a sibling, cousin, spouse, or friend to help you chop and the dinner will go by quicker than you’d think. 

**Eating Out**

When we did go out, I tried all the food. Cactus fries were among my favorite new food from [The Cowboy Club](http://www.cowboyclub.com) in Sedona, along with the ginger lamb I got at [The Himalayan Gril](http://www.himalayangrill.com/hgflg.html) in Flagstaff.
