My office has a **Tuesday Salad Club** - isn’t that the coolest thing ever? Definitely my type of club. The salad club is basically a giant salad potluck. Everybody brings any salad fixings they have and every week we fill one to two tables full of different ingredients!

	Commonly seen ingredients:

* Tomatoes 

* Olives

* Nuts 

* Seeds 

* Avocado 

* Veggies of all kinds
 
* Shredded cheese

Occasionally we even have fresh veggies and/or fruit from people’s gardens, too. Everybody brings their own giant bowl and we all gorge ourselves on salad! It’s my favorite: I get to eat as much as I want without feeling any guilt!

Anyway, one day somebody brought a store bought salad dressing that was incredible. She said it was peach balsamic vinegar with cinnamon that she added olive oil to. I begged her to tell me where she got it from and of course she didn’t remember, and I haven’t seen her since. So frustrating! Anyway, I remembered all of the major ingredients and, after a few tries and a bit of research, I figured out how to make something very similar. 

	Ingredients:

•	1 peach

•	1 cinnamon stick

•	1 cup balsamic vinegar

•	1/3 cups olive oil

	Directions:

1.	Heat balsamic vinegar in saucepan until it just comes to a boil, but do not let it boil.

2.	While vinegar is heating, chop up the peach into 1 inch chunks and place them with the cinnamon stick in a sealable glass jar, such as a mason jar.

3.	Once the vinegar is steaming, pour it over the peaches into the jar. Seal, and let sit in a dark place for about a week.

4.	After a week, strain out the peach *(see above picture* and remove the cinnamon stick. Mix the vinegar with olive oil and salt, and your salad dressing is ready!



*To Store:*

Keep in sealed jar in the fridge to keep it fresh and longer-lasting.
