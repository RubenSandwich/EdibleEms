I got this recipe idea from some website I found when I first started cooking during college. It tasted amazing, but the problem was that it required you to be home for several hours in order to start the chicken first, then add the bell peppers, stir in the middle, and bake for over an hour total. I am rarely home for that long at a time, even on most weekends. This issue, combined with the fact that I couldn’t even find the original recipe, inspired me to create this crockpot version of what I remember from that meal. It cooks long enough for a full 8-hour workday plus commute time. You do have to add the bell peppers 1-2 hours after putting in the chicken so they do not become too watery, though, but if you pre-chop everything in the morning you won’t have to fuss with anything besides lifting the lid and dropping them in a few hours before dinner. This meal is much less fickle than baking, plus the slow cooker makes the chicken just fall off the bone and really soak in the flavors while it cooks all day.

<br>

**Crockpot Balsamic & Bell Pepper Chicken**

*Serves 6*


	Ingredients:





* Olive oil or butter

* 1 whole chicken

* 1 red bell pepper

* 1 yellow bell pepper

* 1 green bell pepper

* ½ sweet onion 

* 2 Tablespoons balsamic vinegar

* 2 Tablespoons dried (or 4 T fresh) rosemary

* Salt & pepper

<br>

	Directions:







1.	Prepare chicken: remove insides, rub with salt, pepper, and rosemary.

2.	Line crockpot with butter or olive oil so the food will not stick.

3.	Core bell peppers and remove seeds (the seeds can be kept and dried out for planting, if desired. It is very easy to grow your own bell peppers from the seeds.) Cut into thick slices. Cut the onion into slices.

4.	Add the chicken to the crockpot with the sliced sweet onion and pour the balsamic vinegar over the top. Turn the crockpot to low and cook for 6-8 hours.

5.	Coat the sliced bell peppers with a touch of olive oil, balsamic vinegar and salt & pepper. Place them on top of the chicken and cook for 1-2 (or not more than 4) additional hours. It is important to add the bell peppers later as they should not cook as long as the chicken needs to, otherwise they will become soggy.

**Make it a whole meal - serve with:**

* Roasted squash

* Rice

* Roasted or sautéed vegetables

* Big green salad

* Potatoes

<br>


At the end of the day, this is what you will come home to! I hate that crockpot dishes always look kind of dark and wilted, but they always taste amazing. :) I served mine as pictured below with roasted fennel. A warning though: the first time I made this I added everything at once and the bell peppers turned very soggy (as you can see from the pictures above and below this comment). I wouldn't have the bell peppers cook for more than 4 hours.

*Notes:*

* You can use any color or combination of color bell peppers, I just like using three different kinds to make a more attractive presentation.
