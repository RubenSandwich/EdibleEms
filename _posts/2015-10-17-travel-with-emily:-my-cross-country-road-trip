As many of you probably already know, I spent the last week driving with my husband from Portland, OR to our new home in Pittsburgh, PA. 

Since we were tugging our U-haul with this tiny car, it made for a slow trip and long days. We spent an average of 11 hours in the car each day, which meant that both breakfast and lunches were in the car and our dinners were rushed. However, I felt like I was still able to stay healthy and not totally ruin my diet. 

First, a summary of the trip, and then on to the food!

<br>

**THE TRIP**

The trip was broken into 6 days.

*Day 1:*

A four-hour drive to Selah, WA to visit my parents. Not much scenery to note, but we did manage to snap a picture of our cat, **Archimedes**, hiding behind the fireplace. We were so sad to drop him off, but he could not handle the 6 day drive with us, so my parents will be shipping him to us later.

*Day 2:* 

A 13-hour drive to Utah. 

Found some interesting souvenirs...

...and made a short detour for a very worth-seeing bridge, the **Perrine Memorial Bridge.** If you look closely you can see someone (parachuting) off the side of the bridge! This bridge is apparently a commonly used area to parachute!

*Day 3:* 

10 hours of brown and 1 hour of green! On through Utah, Wyoming, and ending in Colorado!

It was interesting to see how the country changed as we drove through. Each part is beautiful in its own unique way.

*Day 4:* 

First signs of the East Coast (Driving through Kansas and landing in Kansas City. Which is in Missouri by the way, not Kansas....)

*Day 5:* 

Nashville! After a 10 hour drive.... We could have gotten to Pittsbugh way quicker if we hadn't made this stop. But then we wouldn't have gotten to try [Monell's](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/dine-with-emily-monells)!

<br>

*Day 6:*

On to Pittsburgh! **We woke up at 2am** (yes, we are definitely crazy!) to get to the leasing office in time to pick up our keys. But it was worth it to get a home and have a good home-cooked meal!

**HOW I STAYED (RELATIVELY) HEALTHY ON THE ROAD**

Over the past few years as I have become more conscious about how I eat, my travels have looked pretty different. At first I thought I could just abandon my healthy eating and not worry about health during the short (relatively) time I am on vacation. However, due to a combination of older age and becoming used to eating a certain way, **eating the way I used to when on vacation was just not working.** Eating out and snacking on greasy junk food no longer sits well with my stomach. After only a day or two of eating out and eating more **“bad” foods**, I will get sick to the point where it ruins my vacation. So, in the past year I have made an effort to discover how I can indulge and enjoy my vacations while also keeping up my health and good habits I have worked so hard to create. 

This has inspired me to start the series **"Travel With Emily,"** in which I will relate to you my tips and tricks for **eating healthy on the road.** Each time I take a vacation, business trip, etc., I will write a review of my experience, lessons learned, and any other advice I discover. I am definitely a **work in progress,** but I hope that my tales will be an encouragement and support for my audience!

<br>

**MY TIPS**

Even if one has a stomach of steel and can eat anything without feeling sick (like my husband!), a lot of people want to stay healthy just for health itself, or perhaps to even lose weight. Here’s what I have discovered works for me and may be helpful for you, too. ☺

* *Breakfast:* 

Eggs travel surprisingly well & are quick to fry up if you have **access to a kitchen** (I suggest AirBNB). One day I just ate a granola bar and banana, which was fine since we were not active during the drive.

* *Drinks:* 

Honestly this was difficult, as I missed my morning tea and it was difficult to find clean drinks at gas stations, where we had to stop. We couldn’t go out of our way to find a grocery store, so I wish I would have stocked up on bottled matchas, sweetener-free teas, kombucha, and cold brew for something to sip on while driving. I brought some bagged teas, but if we were not in a hotel, it was hard to find hot water.

* *Lunches:* 

All in the car. Epic bars, canned tuna & mayo (make sure to **bring a can opener!**), smoked salmon on plantain chips, salami w/mustard, prosciutto wrapped on anything (fruit, veggies, or plain). 
**See pictures below.**

* *What was in our cooler:* 

We traveled with mayo, mustard, salami, prosciutto, smoked salmon, apples, cheese for Ruben, carrots, and sugar snap peas. We bought ice once a day and kept the items cold in the fridge at our various AirBNB places at night.

* *Snacks:* 

Nuts, dried mango (not too much dried fruit for **the stink factor**), raw veggies (first few days), seaweed, almond butter packets, avocados w/sea salt, bell peppers (mid-week grocery store run)

* *Dinner:* 

Most nights [we went out](http://www.emily.rubennic.com/recipes/dine-with-emily-monells). To pick a healthy restaurant, I tend to either **1) Find a pre-made salad** at Trader Joes or another health grocery store and add my own olive oil (you can buy travel-size bottles to make it easier) and salt (usually pretty easy to travel), or **2) Indulge!** If you allow yourself to have some treats, usually it will make it easier to resist all day. Self-control really is a limited resource. I try not to go too crazy, like order mac  & cheese when I really cannot tolerate dairy, but I’ll have something with goat or feta or else some cheese sprinkled on the top.

<br>

**Possible Improvements/Lessons Learned:** 

1. Bring special drinks/teas - it is really nice to sip on something besides water every once in a while

2. Clean granola bars were hard to find 

3. Plan stops near grocery stores (if possible)

4. Bring empty jars or Tupperware for food waste and leftovers 

5. Pre-peel the hard boiled eggs (just makes it easier in the car) 

6. BRING CHOCOLATE (I resisted at first, but all the crappy, [slavery-made](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/30/lawsuit-your-candy-bar-was-made-by-child-slaves.html) gas station chocolate was surprisingly tempting.

*Epic Bars are basically a meal replacement - so filling!*

*Seaweed for when we wanted something salty.*

*Justin's brand has these great single-serving pouches that, while not very environmentally friendly, are good for an occasional road trip.*

<br>

*A turkey, salami, & avocado roll-up. These can be super easily made while in the car (the passenger, not the person driving!) or real quickly when stopped for gas.*
