**Turkey Wraps**

*Serves  2 as a meal, 4 as a side*

<br>

I don’t know about you, but after Thanksgiving I always end up with so much turkey! It seems that is the one dish that can never be completely eaten up. Here’s a fresh way to use the leftover turkey so you don’t get tired of the bird. Plus it’s **an easy way to get your leafy greens in** (and in a palatable way, too).

This is also a good recipe for anytime you find turkey, particularly for those needing a **portable recipe to take to work**. (I know I’m always looking for new lunch ideas!) 

<br>

	Ingredients:

•	2 cups cooked turkey, cubed

•	4 slices bacon

•	½ onion

•	4 leaves of swiss chard, or some other dark leafy green

•	2 T mayonnaise (or more to taste)

•	Black pepper

<br>


	Directions:

Lay the bacon slices in a pan and cook on the stove over medium heat until crispy.

While the bacon is cooking, chop the onion into small, bite-sized pieces.

Once the bacon is cooked, set it aside on a plate, leaving the stove on medium heat and the bacon grease in the pan.

Sautee the onion in the bacon grease for about 5 minutes or so, until they begin to soften and turn brown. Once the onions have hit this state, add the turkey and continue to sauté unitil the turkey warms up. 

While the turkey is warming and the onions are cooking, separate the leaves of the swiss chard or other greens, rinse them off, and set them on a plate.

Lie a slice of bacon along the spine of each leaf. The bacon will make the wraps more sturdy (and also tasty!).

Take the turkey & onions out of the pan and mix with the mayonnaise and black pepper.

After the leaves are prepared and the turkey/onion mixture is ready, place a few spoonfuls of the turkey on top of the bacon, roll up the wraps, and eat! (They don’t stay perfectly rolled, but rather you will have to hold the as you eat as shown in the picture below).
