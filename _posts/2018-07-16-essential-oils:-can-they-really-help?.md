**My Exploration With Essential Oils**

I have been pretty late to the game when it comes to essential oils.

I just started experimenting with them starting about a month ago. I have personally noticed that they help alleviate my symptoms, especially with anxiousness. As a caveat, I do not have diagnosed anxiety, but only a propensity toward anxious thoughts. So if you are struggling with anxiety you should first and foremost talk to you doctor. But essential oils can help supplement your doctor’s protocol, or help out in minor cases that may not be technically diagnosed but that still cause stress in a person’s life.

**Techniques I’ve Tried**

A friend told me that dropping some oils onto your collarbone and then taking a short walk is an instant way to reduce stress and I’ve found that to be completely true! They have been especially helpful when I take mindfulness walks, which are basically just uninterrupted periods of walking focused on staying mindful the entire time. 

When I feel tense I get bergamot out of my purse, which is said to be help with stress, and either just smell it while taking a few slow breaths or even dap a bit onto my collarbone and focus on inhaling the scent. 

At night I frequently have difficulty settling down, so lavender and lemongrass have been delightful scents to help me feel calm and centered.

**So can essential oils really help me?**

Whether it be anxiety, depression, focus, or countless other issues, essential oils are said to be helpful in many circumstances and by many people. 

Maybe it’s the placebo effect, maybe it’s science. Either way I know what has been helping me and even if it makes a tiny difference and it is all because I have convinced myself, why does that even matter? What works, works. Doesn’t matter why. 

Because of my great experience so far, I definitely plan to continue experimenting. Stay tuned for updates on my essential oil exploration!
