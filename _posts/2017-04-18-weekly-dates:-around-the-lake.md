**Weekend At the Lake**

![IMG_5025.JPG](/content/IMG_5025.JPG)

We had been craving some nature time in addition to some alone time, so this year for Ruben’s birthday I took him to Lake Stoneycreek, a short drive away from Pittsburgh. 

The best part of this weekend was that I kept it a surprise from Ruben until we were about an hour away on the drive there! 

To be honest the cabin we stayed at was super inexpensive but I wouldn’t recommend it, so I’m not going to link to the rental. I found it on Airbnb and although I’ve never had a bad experience with the company, I definitely found a bit of a dud in this cabin. 

The lake, though, was nice. We both agreed we’d love to see it in the summer or fall as well when it’s a bit warmer (the whole weekend it was 40 and windy despite the 60 degree weather just a bit North in Pittsburgh). 

The point was to spend time with each other and without Wi-Fi or people anywhere close, we certainly had an easier time doing this. The concept is something I highly suggest and will be sure to repeat in my own life!


**Reading Evening**

Sometimes, our dates are super exciting like staying in a cabin at a lake (or at least that's exciting for me!). Other weeks, we are busy and tired from our last date and don't want to go anywhere. Sure, the lake was fun and it was relaxing to get away from home, but on the other hand that meant that we gave up our weekend chore time and had a lot to catch up on the following week. So, this week we decided to take it easy and relax with a new (old) TV show that we just started watching: Silicon Valley. R thinks it's hilarious because he gets all the nerdy tech jokes. I like the first two episodes that we watched together and then promptly stopped watching. Personally, I'd prefer to watch Gilmore Girls over just about anything else but can't usually talk R into watching with me ;)

So after the weekend away, we decided that our date this past week would be a simple reading date at home. 

We are currently reading through Steinbeck’s *The Winter of our Discontent*, which has been fabulous, but I would never suggest it to be read aloud. It is a slower paced and wordy book so it’s beautifully written so I would have loved to curl up with it and read it myself, but reading out loud (which is what we tend to do) makes it go so slowly and makes it a bit harder to understand if you aren’t the one reading and looking at the words. We definitely could have read it separately and then come together to discuss, but that just isn’t our style at this point and we take a bit of a risk picking out books that we guess we could read out loud. Sometimes it doesn’t work out perfectly and that is ok. This book is still definitely worth readying though.
