Today was the first day of my third **(yes, third!)** go around at [Diane Sanfilippo's 21-Day Sugar Detox](http://balancedbites.com/21dsd), I think it will be a great reset for me and I am especially excited because my husband is doing it with me!

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**What is the 21-Day Sugar Detox?**</span>

You can learn all about the program [here](www.21dsd.com) or through the book [here](http://www.amazon.com/21-Day-Sugar-Detox-Cravings-Naturally/dp/1936608111/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446492202&sr=8-1&keywords=21+day+sugar+detox) or even from podcasts [here](http://balancedbites.com/podcast/) (I have the book, which is the guide I will be using to follow). Basically it is a **whole foods based** program that focuses on eating **foods from nature** and cutting out processed foods. It is also meant to change your tastes to be more sensitive to sweet foods, which is why even the fruits that are allowed are few and are more bitter-tasting (green apple, grapefruit, and green-tipped bananas are the only fruits allowed). I love this program because it does not feel restrictive, there is no calorie counting, it is safe, and focuses on feeling better rather than just losing weight!

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**Why do the 21-Day Sugar Detox?**</span>


My intent for this challenge is not to lose weight or really change anything aesthetically for me (although the last two times I tried the detox my skin got way clearer and I would not be sad if that happened again!). Rather, I am hoping to become less dependent on my "sugar fix" that I have gotten used to in the past few months or so. There has been a lot going on in my life right now, so in a lot of ways my health has been taking a backseat. Hopefully this challenge will get me back into control of my cravings and my health!

<br>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**Third Try**</span>


I will be completely honest in saying that I have never done this challenge successfully before. The first try I only lasted two weeks, and the second try I lasted 19 days, which was so frustrating! Both times I had planned well and removed temptations from my house, but caved under **emotional stress.** I realize this is an extremely bad habit and I am glad that I was at least able to see that I have this problem through the last two challenges. Bit by bit I am working on become more emotionally independent of food and through this process I am learning to deal with my emotions in healthier ways.

Yesterday was our last meal before the detox. **Breakfast for Dinner** included roasted brussel sprouts & bacon from [Nom Nom Paleo's blog](http://nomnompaleo.com/post/1670459416/roasted-brussels-sprouts-and-bacon) with (non-green) apples, pears, and [pumpkin pancakes](http://balancedbites.com/2012/10/easy-recipe-pumpkin-pancakes-from-practical-paleo.html) with lots of maple syrup! We also ate corn chips and (very sugary!) coconut-milk ice cream at our friend's house while watching a football game. So we really indulged the day before the detox! Maybe not the best idea....
