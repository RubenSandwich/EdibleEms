<br>

**Ingredients:**

* 1 T butter, olive oil, or coconut oil 

* 4 eggs

* 2 T milk or milk substitute (any kind)

* 1 tsp dried oregano

* 4-5 pieces thin-sliced salami

* Â¼ cup black olives, chopped

* Fresh cracked pepper (no need for salt since the salami is salty)

* Other optional toppings: sliced bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, etc.

* Also optional: good quality, grass-fed raw cheese to top, if you can tolerate it

<br>

**Directions:**

1. Melt the butter or oil on a small frying pan over medium heat.

2. Beat the eggs and milk together and add to the hot pan.

3. Once the eggs are starting to harden but are still cooking, distribute the salami in a circular shape around the pan. Sprinkle the oregano and olive slices on top, along with any additional toppings desired.

4. Once the eggs are all cooked (should take no more than 5-6 minutes), sprinkle some freshly cracked pepper on top, transfer to plates, and enjoy!
