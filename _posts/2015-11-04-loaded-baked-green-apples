**Either my husband has been on the sugar detox for too long, or these are fantastic.** 

I made these for him a few days ago and I did not mention that it was a recipe I was testing until after he tried it. So after finishing half of one apple, he licked his lips and exclaimed "These are super good Emily!" 


My husband tends to be stingy with his compliments, so when he says he likes something I know he honestly means it. I was so excited that he felt as if they were good enough for dessert, especially since they are completely **21-Day Sugar Detox friendly!** They are a dessert that is easy, tasty, and great for your health! I could be on the detox forever with this treat!

*The nut topping is optional, but I think it adds a nice crunch to the dessert.*

<br>

	Ingredients (Serves 4):

* 2 green apples

* 1/2 cup hazelnut butter (almond and sunflower seed work well too)

* 1/4 cup unsweetened coconut flakes

* About 1/8 cup mix of cashews, almonds, or other 21-DSD friendly nuts (for specifics, look here

	Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

2. Roughly chop the mixed nuts to make them easier to bite into.

3. Stir together the hazelnut (or other nut) butter and coconut flakes.

4. Remove the core from the apples without cutting them in half (so you are creating a hole in the middle of the apples while they are still standing upright) and fill the hole with the mixture from step 3. Top with the apples with the chopped nuts. It is easier to simply turn the apples upside down onto the chopped nuts so that they will just stick right on to the top of the apple (see picture above the directions).

5. Put the apples on a greased baking sheet and bake in the oven for 30 minutes. (The greased baking sheet is important because often times the mixture will spill over onto the pan and, trust me, it is not fun to clean up if you forgot to grease the pan!) Let the apples cool for 5 minutes before digging in.

6. To serve, cut the apples through the middle from the top down and place on its side, as shown in the picture below. One half apple is the perfect serving size for one person for dessert or a snack.
