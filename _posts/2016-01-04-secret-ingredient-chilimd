This could also be called Ruben's Chili, since it was created with his approval. Ruben is the King of Chli, and he is VERY picky about his chili. According to him, the rules are as follows:

1. There has to be two kinds of beans: black and kidney (so this recipe is not Paleo-friendly at all).

2. Ground beef is the preferred meat choice, although this is not imperative. Turkey, pork, and even chicken work as well, but beef is superior to them all.

3. Spice is a must. Non-spicy chili is not chili.

4. The chili must be topped with pickles! (The Secret Ingredient!) I thought this was SO weird at first and I used to judge him, until I realized it really tastes great! Or maybe that is because I have just gotten used to it over time...

	Ingredients:

* 2 T Olive oil

* 1 onion

* 3 cloves garlic

* 2 roma tomatoes

* 1 tsp tomato paste

* 2 T tomato sauce

* 1 carrot

* 1/2 lb ground beef

* 1/4 cup dry red beans, cooked

* 1/4 cup dry black beans, cooked

* 2 jalapeños for medium spiciness (or 1 for mild spiciness) 

* 1 tsp cumin

* 1 tsp paprika

* 1 tsp chili powder

* Salt & pepper

* Pinch of turmeric, optional

<br>

	Directions:

1. If you bought dried beans, be sure to cook them thoroughly first. Uncooked beans are NOT good on the digestion.

2. Chop EVERYTHING that needs to be chopped (onion, garlic, carrot, pickle, jalapeños, tomatoes). 

3. Cook the ground beef in butter or coconut oil and add a pinch of both salt & pepper when it is cooked through.

4. Put a drizzle of butter or olive oil into a large saucepan or crockpot so the ingredients do not stick. Turn the heat on low and add all of the ingredients, including the spices. Cook on low for 3-4 hours for the crockpot, or 1-2 hours for the stovetop to get all the flavors nicely assimilated. Stir occasionally. 

5. Before serving, taste a bit and adjust salt & pepper as needed. Enjoy!
