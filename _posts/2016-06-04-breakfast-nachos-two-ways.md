I realized my site was completely lacking in breakfast recipes and ideas! Well, I decided I must change that. We are starting out with a bang, with breakfast NACHOS! Yes, you heard right, you can eat nachos at breakfast!! These are even dairy free but the guacamole keeps them from being too dry. Perfecto!

<br>

**Dairy Free Breakfast Nachos:**

Serves 2-3

<br>

	Ingredients:
 
* 4 medium russet potatoes

* 4 T olive oil

* 1 T butter

* 3 large onions

* 3 strips of bacon

* 1/2 lb ground turkey

* 1 beefsteak tomato 

* 1 Jalapeño

* Cilantro, for garnish

* Guacamole for serving

<br>

	Directions:

1. Caramelize the onions: this is optional but highly recommended. If you do not have time to caramelize, simply slice [into ring-shape] and saute in butter or olive oil for 10 minutes or so. If you are caramelizing, put the chopped onions into a crockpot with salt, 1 tsp of sugar, 1 T olive oil, and the butter on low for about 4 hours minimum, or overnight. 

2. When the onions are done cooking, fry them in another tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat to get them brown and crispy. 

3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

4. Peel (optionally) and thinly slice (not optional) the potatoes. Place them on a pre-greased baking sheet, drizzle olive oil on top, and roast in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until soft. This will vary depending on how thinly you slice them to be sure to watch carefully the first couple of times you make this! 

5. While the potatoes are baking, cook the bacon, then the ground turkey in the bacon fat. Finish the caramelized onions, chop the jalapeno, tomato, and green onions. Place all of this on top of the potatoes when they are cooked.

6. You are, of course, welcome to add grated cheese if you can tolerate it but this recipe certainly doesn’t need it. :)

7. Bake for another 15 minutes, then top with cilantro and guacamole.

	Ingredients:

* 4 medium sweet potatoes

* 3 large  onions

* 3 strips of bacon

* 1/2 lb ground turkey

* 1 beefsteak tomato 

* 1 Jalapeño

* Cilantro, for garnish

* Guacamole for serving

	Directions:

1. Peel and thinly slice the potatoes. You must peel sweet potatoes as their skin is not great for the human digestive system.

If you are caramelizing, put the chopped onions into a crockpot with salt, 1 tsp of sugar, 1 T olive oil, and the butter on low for about 4 hours minimum, or overnight.
