*Part 1 of The Story of Ruben and Emily*

<br>

After celebrating my second year anniversary, I have been doing lots of reflecting and have realized that 6 years in a relationship and 2 years married has given us quite a bit of history together. I know many other people have way more experience than I do, but I can’t help but think and want to share about our story and the years that it took to get to this place. Plus I just like to reminisce. :)

<br>

…………………………………………………………………………………………………………….......................................................

<br>

I always thought I would find my husband at college. All three of my older siblings found their significant others at college, so that’s where you meet people right? 

That meant I had four years to find someone or I wouldn’t get married.

Seriously, this was how my 18-year-old mind worked!

Soon after coming to college, though, I realized that there was nobody there for me (in a romantic way, the community aspect of college was great though). At 18, though, and deep into my studies, I wasn’t particularly worried about it. I had always wanted to work at a summer camp just as my siblings did (and all had great things to say about it), and I found a great opportunity to be a counselor at Black Lake Bible Camp in Olympia, WA.

There were absolutely no thoughts toward finding a romantic partner at camp, and actually in general at that time. I mean, I definitely wondered about it, but my vague outline was that I would still find someone later in college, or else afterward at my church or somewhere like that and get married several years after graduating.

Plus, I was only 18-turning-19 that summer, so the concept of a serious relationship wasn’t even something I was thinking about.

All that to say that I did not expect to meet anybody at camp or in the near future at all. Since you all know how this story ultimately ends, it’s hard to explain how much of a surprise this was to me. Anyway, I’m getting ahead of myself. This is how it happened.


As my mother was dropping off, we met a group of second-year staffers who introduced themselves in their camp names. Two animals, a cartoon character, and a food item. You thought you were bad with names? Try learning two names for each person! Well, one of those animal-esque names was Shepherd. Nothing stood out to me at the time but when I think about it later it is ironic that he was one of the first people I met.

Eating every single meal together and spending all day with the same group of people gave me a lot of exposure to every single person at camp. A lot of the people were very outgoing and joke-y, Shepherd being no different, and even on the jokier (not a word but the only thing I could think of to describe it) of the people there.

At the end of the week, however, Shepherd got onto the stage at one of our evening sessions not to make a joke but to deliver one of the most powerful messages I had ever heard. He spoke about community, the power of friendship, and how it exhibits Christ’s love. That Christians (and communities in general) can be so dang judgemental and exclusive! Using his words to both convict and encourage, this message was completely relevant and thought-provoking. Perhaps an unintended consequence of Shepherd’s words were that they really got me thinking….about him, though, as well as his message. Although I was initially struck that Shepherd was all jokes, this made me realize he can be perfectly serious, and downright intelligent! No, it was not love at first sight or even “like” at this point, but it did give me some serious respect for this guy who was so much more than what he appeared.
