This pasta recipe is a meal you can feel good about, since it uses rice pasta (brown or white are both great options) and omega-3 rich salmon. It is dairy free, gluten free, and makes for a perfect portable lunch for the workday. I take this to work at least once a month and I'm sure you will too now once you try it!

<br>

*Ingredients:*


* 1 lb uncooked rice pasta (brown or white both work)

* 1 8oz can salmon

* 1/2 cup frozen peas

* 1/3 cup mayo (try a cleaner version that uses avocado oil instead of canoloa and/or soy oil)

* Salt & pepper to taste

* 3 T fresh basil, chopped, optional

<br>

*Directions:*

1. Fill approximately a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. 

2. Once water is boiling, add rice pasta and cook until al dente (~10 minutes for brown rice pasta and ~8 minutes for white rice pasta).

3. Boil 1 cup of water and add the peas. Cook peas for about 5 minutes, or until soft and warmed through. 

4. While the pasta and peas are cooking, prepare the rest of the salad. Put the salmon in a large bowl and stir in the mayonaise. Add a bit of salt & pepper and stir.

5. Once the peas and pasta are cooked, drain and add to the bowl with the salmon. Stir again and add more mayo if needed. Adjust seasonings to taste, add fresh basil if you have it, and enjoy the salad!
