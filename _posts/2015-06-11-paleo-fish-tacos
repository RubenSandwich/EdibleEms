Never mind that these tacos are both gluten free, dairy free, and also paleo - they are just simply amazing! You would not have even known they were healthy if you tried them first. :)

	Ingredients:

* 1 T sliced radishes

* 1 cucumber, chopped

* 1/2 pound (typically about 2 fillets) fresh tilapia

* 1 T cilantro

* 1 head napa cabbage (You will only need about 1/4 of the head, but don't chop it up! Read the directions first.)

* 1 lime

<br>

	Directions:

1. Cook the tilapia either by saut√©ing in a pan with butter, or broiling in the oven for about 10 minutes. You know the fish is done when it becomes a sort of darker white, (if that makes sense). It can also be easily fluffed with a fork when cooked.

2. While the tilapia is cooking, carefully peel off the outer leaves of the cabbage. You will need about 3-4 leaves per person, depending on how full they stuff their leaves. Cabbage is easy to use for wraps because it is so stiff and holds in place even better than a tortilla (too floppy) or a taco (too crumbly).

3. Stuff cabbage leaves with the taco fixings in no particular order, squeeze some lime juice over the top and enjoy!
