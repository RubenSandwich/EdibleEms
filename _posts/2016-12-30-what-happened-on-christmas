**A Week Long Engagement**

After Ruben proposed, everything was bliss. I had just finished the school semester, was well on my way to graduate in a few months, and we were heading into Christmas within the next week. Life was so good! Until Christmas...

**Christmas Day 2013**

Ruben’s plan was to propose right before Christmas, when we would be heading up to my family’s house in WA State to spend the weekend before the holiday with them. My parents decided to visit my brother in South Carolina for Christmas, so we had an early celebration with them before they left on Christmas Eve, then headed back to Portland for Christmas Day. 

This is important to know because it shows the weight of everything that happened that day. We had visited R’s parents the same day we got engaged to celebrate with them, and the air definitely seemed a bit tense then. However, I was in such bliss that I didn’t really think much of it. I thought “they MUST be happy for us.” Why wouldn’t they be?

Well, they sure told us why they weren’t – at first.

Immediately following our Christmas dinner, R’s father stood up and stated “Ruben and Emily need to stay. We need to speak about the wedding.” I immediately realized something was wrong but tried to convince myself that they just wanted to know more of the details (all we had spoken of until that day was the location and date).

**Making Compromises**

I will spare you the details of the conversation, but we discovered that R’s parents were devastated and hurt by the fact that we wanted a simple and small park wedding at Mt Tabor where R proposed. I offered to have a Romanian reception, allow their pastor to speak, and to of course have R’s family invite anyone they wanted from their church and extended family. 

Nothing was enough. 

Finally R spoke up and said “Ok, we will have a Romanian church wedding then.” I was so shocked I couldn’t say anything initially but thought “Hey, that’s not something I agreed to!” I could rationally understand the importance of having a traditional wedding, but could not fathom the fact that we could not make it simple, choose our own speaker, or even hold it anywhere other than a church I was unfamiliar with! This entirely changed everything and I was not sure I was ok with it. But I slowly came to the realization that I needed to give up any idea of a gathering that R and I had been thinking of having. As painful as losing that special memory sounded, it was clearly the better choice to keep a good relationship with family.

**Choices and Other Things Brides Aren’t Entitled To**

The next day I realized that giving up our wedding would not allow for a good relationship with family. My family, that is. When I called my mom and explained the situation out loud, talking through it combined with her questions made me realize that giving up on a family wedding would in turn hurt my parents very much, particularly my father who took pride in being involved in “giving me away.” The Romanian tradition did not allow for this interaction to take place and also kept our family in the dark by having most of the service in Romanian with no translation. 

This “compromise” was not actually a compromise but an entire takeover. Although I was willing to do this, my family and especially my mother and father, were not willing to let me give up my wedding day. I’m so glad they stood up for me, as it seemed at this point that I couldn’t have the special time with all my family and friends in one place like I had so been looking forward to for a long time. 

**The Solution**

The plan we came up with was as perfect as this situation could be, which was to have two separate weddings. Both immediate families would come to both of the weddings and this way everyone could have a ceremony that was special to them.

The hardest part: since my family was coming from out of town and all over, we had to have the weddings on the same day. This was a long day and even longer to plan! 

Check back in for details about the planning process and the actual day in the weeks to come.
