Immediately after college, I became very deficient in reading. I realized that all throughout college I was either doing required reading or just spent too many hours crunched over a textbook of some kind and took a hiatus, unintentionally, from reading. I realized about a year ago that it has been too long since I’ve read anything fun, insightful, inspiring, or… well since I’ve read anything at all! 

I read a few books while I took some time off and then throughout my job search and started ordering audio books. Starting with the most non-intellectual books and assuming that they were better than nothing, I have gone through more books in the last year than I read for fun in my 4 years in college. 

But something has happened in the past few months that has got me reading more than ever, and I wanted to share this trick with you.  

The change was this: less time on social media. 

The trick? Use social media to become inspired about reading. 

I discovered that there are so many great Instagram accounts that either show book suggestions or just beautiful pictures of cozy reading settings and other people getting excited about reading. It has helped so much as I have been scrolling through my IG feed and then suddenly coming across an image that speaks to me enough to make me stop, put my phone down, and take my book out instead. 

The benefits of this have not only been more reading, but better sleep, decreased anxiety, and

The accounts I follow currently include:

•	Bibliofeed

How about you, any inspiring (book or other related) accounts that you follow anywhere on social media?
