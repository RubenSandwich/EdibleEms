Like any other flavor of kombucha, this recipe is so simple it’s almost ridiculous to write down. Add a jalapeno to your latest back of kombucha for just 1 hour or up to overnight and you’ve got spicy flavored ‘booch! The sparkling water just puts it over the edge, too. I know I will be drinking this all summer long!

<br>

	Ingredients:

* 1 batch plain [kombucha](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/citrus-kombucha)

* 1 - 8 oz can sparkling water, either plain or lime flavored (I love [La Croix](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00851GRW6?ie=UTF8&tag=edib09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B00851GRW6))

* 1 jalapeño


<br>

	Directions:

1. Brew your kombucha as per directions [here](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/citrus-kombucha).

2. Once the kombucha has finished brewing and is ready to drink, now it is time to make it extra special. Chop the jalapeno into thin rings, then add to your growler or jar along with the sparkling water.

3. Seal the lid, and led the kombucha “marinate,” so to speak, for a minimum of an hour or overnight (or throughout the day if you want something for right when you come home from work - something I highly suggest!).

4. Filter out the jalapeno, pour the kombucha into a glass, and enjoy!
