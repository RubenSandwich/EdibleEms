When I went to Ecuador several months ago, I learned so much about food. I ate in a whole different way than I normally do and had many dishes that I had never tried or even heard of. This dish is a recreation of one of my most favorite dishes I tried while in Ecuador. It is not nearly as wonderful as the authentic dish I was made, but it makes me reminiscent and gives me all sorts of happy feelings when I make it.

	Directions:

1. Mash plantains with a fork or in a food processor, then add a bit of salt and stir again.

2. Heat a frying pan to medium-high hight and add the coconut oil. While the pan is heating, form the mashed plantains into circles, as thin as you can get them. Once the heat is hot, add the plantain circles and let fry for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until crispy. Remove from pan and let cool for a few minutes before forming (step 6).

3. While the plantains are frying, start a pot of boiling water for the fish. Once the water is boiling, dump the fish in and keep at a low boil until the fish is cooked. White fish usually cooks within 5 minutes and you can tell if it is cooked by noticing the color. When the fish is done it will be white and flaky.

4. While the fish is cooking and the plantains are frying, chop the green onions, chills, onion, and garlic. (Be sure to be watching the other two pots/pans while you complete this step). Start a third stovetop heating and add more coconut oil, EVOO, or butter. Saut√© the onions first until they are translucent, then add the garlic and chills. Save the green onions for toppings. 

5. Once the onion mixture is soft, transfer to a food processor, blend until smooth, and bring back to the pan. Add the tapioca flour and then the stock/broth. Stir! Bring to a simmer and continue to simmer the mixture until it is no longer watery, but more pasty, like a sauce.

6. When the plantains are cooled enough to work with, curve the edges up to form miniature bowls and press them for a few seconds to get the sides to stay up. This is very difficult and I have yet to make them stay as nice as I saw them in Ecuador. (Perhaps a mold would be helpful, but for now my fingers will have to do!) Regardless of shape, though, they will still taste fine.

7.  Drain the fish when it is done cooking, mix with the chili sauce, and sprinkle in lime juice from the lime. Add salt & pepper to taste and fill the plantain cups with the mixture. Top with green onions and serve with extra lime slices!

	Pairing Idea:

White rice was always served as a side in Ecuador, sometimes even for breakfast!
