Mother's Day is just around the corner and it has me thinking of how much my mom used to cook for me when I was a kid. It is only fair to cook for her for at least one day out of the year! Give your mom a break this year and try these easy recipes that I know she will love. 

<br>

**If I was with my my mom today, here is what I would be cooking:**

<br>

To start, you absolutely must have coffee! [Cold Brew Coffee](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/cold-brew-coffee) is great because you can easily make it the night before so your morning is less hectic. Plus, it sounds way fancier than the average cup of coffee. :)

This fancy [Kale Salad With Avocado, Almonds, & Craisins](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/kale-salad-with-avocado-almonds-craisins) will be sure to impress people with hardly any effort.

For dessert, these [Molasses Date Crinkles](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/molasses-date-crinkles) are a cinch to make, are no-bake, and are just the right amount of sweet!

Don't forget to bring a gift! These [Homemade Canned Peaches](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/three-ingredient-canned-peaches) are wonderfully tasty, surprisingly easy to make, and would look so cute in a mason jar wrapped with a pretty ribbon!
