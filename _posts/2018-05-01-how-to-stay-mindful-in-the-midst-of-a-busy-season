A major barrier to incorporating mindfulness in people's’ lives is simply having too much to do. A lot of times that cannot be helped, though. Whether it be raising small children, a demanding job, ….. Sometimes life just becomes full of tasks that you cannot take off your plate for a time. 


So what do you do when circumstances interfere with your peace of mind? 

 

When I encounter seasons of business, I use intentional thoughts and actions that have kept me staying mindful despite less than ideal circumstances. Here are a few examples: 

 

1.     Know that you do not need an abundance of time to practice mindfulness. 

Most simple breathing exercises take 1-3 minutes and make a world of difference in your day. Try some basic mindfulness exercises [here](). 

2.     Finding a community, or even just one other person, who can speak the same language. 

Having support will….. That’s why I love the [classes at Pittsburgh Fitness Project]() and the community around this gym….

3.      Keep in mind that every season is just a season.
Life definitely ebs and flows in many ways, and busyness (sp??)  is one of those. When you’re in the midst of a busy season it seems that it will last forever, but know that life is not meant to be like that. If you need to take steps toward reducing proverbial clutter in your life, start to make a plan for this by envisioning how you want your life to be like, and reverse engineering to find small steps that you can take toward this ideal. Knowing that while you work toward an idealistic life, the time that you are in is not permanent will give you the energy to stay mindful in the present moment.
