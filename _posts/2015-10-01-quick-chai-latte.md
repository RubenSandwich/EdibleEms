Some days you just want a warm comforting, spicy drink. Here's one you can have without even having to leave the comfort of your home.

For one cup, just steep a few ingredients in hot water, milk, or a combination of the two:

* 1 cinnamon stick

* 1/4 teaspoon whole cloves

* 1 whole star anise

* 1-2 teaspoons loose leaf black tea (or 1 plain black tea bag)

* A few peppercorns

I like to use the spices in their whole form, but powdered spices work just as nicely.

Enjoy on a cold winter afternoon while curled up with a good book!
