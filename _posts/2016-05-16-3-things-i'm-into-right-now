There have been a couple of obsessions in my life right now that I cannot stop thinking about! Just thought I had to share with everyone because everybody needs to know about these things!

<br>

**1.) Better Than Before by Gretchen Rubin**

I have been devouring [this book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385348630?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0385348630&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) (and [Gretchen Rubin's](http://gretchenrubin.com) work in general) for the past month or so. I have known about Rubin and her [Happier Podcast](http://gretchenrubin.com/podcast/) for quite some time now, but I am a reader and reading her book has made me 100% more interested. It's weird, but I learn and relate through reading.

Even if you're not like me, though, Rubin has work across pretty much every platform: podcast, blog, books, youtube, etc. I highly suggest you check her out! Nothing I have read has been utterly life-changing, but the little tweaks she has suggested that I've employed in my life so far have added to make a fairly significant change.

**2.) Nut butter packets.**

I already wrote about these less than a week ago for my [travel snacks post](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/road-trip-snacks), but they are worth mentioning again. Many-a-times when I feel super hungry [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ETKJE0?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B004ETKJE0&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) have stopped me from buying a package of cookies to eat all by myself. Seriously. They are sweet, but contain no refined sugar, and are a great treat while traveling or at work. I mean, I definitely have to make sure I don't eat too many nuts because [they aren't the best for you all the time](https://chriskresser.com/another-reason-you-shouldnt-go-nuts-on-nuts/), but they're not the worst thing you could eat either. :)

**3.) Following someone else's meal plan!**

This is so strange because I love to cook and schedule out my life (probably to a fault, really), but sometimes it is so nice to use someone else's meal plan for the week! This week I've been following meal plan from [Practical Paleo](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936608758?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1936608758&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) after returning from a vacation to Boston *(Vlog coming soon!!)* and it has been so refreshing not having to think about what I am going to cook while I am trying to get back into the swing of work and life again. Sometimes even coaches need coaches!

**How about you, what types of treats or other things have you been enjoying lately?**
