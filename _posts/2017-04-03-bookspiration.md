Immediately after college, I became very deficient in reading. I realized that all throughout college I was either doing required reading or just spent too many hours crunched over a textbook of some kind and took a hiatus, unintentionally, from reading. I realized about a year ago that it has been too long since I’ve read anything fun, insightful, inspiring, or… well since I’ve read anything at all!

The accounts I follow currently include:

•	@bibliofeed

•	@bookbaristas

* @sweptawaybooks

* @tender.curiosity

* @bookofthemonthclub

* @emmawatson

* @what.i.read


How about you, any inspiring (book or other related) accounts that you follow anywhere on social media?
