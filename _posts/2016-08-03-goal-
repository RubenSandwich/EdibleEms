	2016 GOAL #4

<br>

I kind of cheated on this one.

I mean, "cook mainly from CSA" is a pretty vague goal, and actually was not my original goal to begin with.

My goal was this: after a year of ordering solely a vegetable CSA, I was going to step it up a notch and order a meat CSA!

**And I did!**

It is delivered to a pickup location near me, which I go to once a week and pick up my veggies in a nice cooler bag (pictured below at the end of the post). It is much more convenient than using the grocery store and taking an hour to shop through the store!

But what I haven't been doing is... using it!

At least not as much as I should. And I am paying for it in lack of freezer space.

I will tell you, it requires an entire **lifestyle switch** from shopping at the grocery store every week to picking up your meats and veggies the day of, not knowing ahead of time what you are going to get. 

The veggies, I got down. Just use what you can and make any extra greens into pesto! Easy-peasy. 

But the meat, I think I ordered too much and we just cannot get through it (plus I do not eat meat for every meal, I enjoy seafood a lot of the times too). But you know what? That's ok because it will last for months in the freezer! So I'm not worried about it and I am going to take my time getting through all of the bacon, grass fed beef, hormone-free chickens, and yummy pastured pork.
