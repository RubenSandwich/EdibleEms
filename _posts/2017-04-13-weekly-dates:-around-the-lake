Week of March 20th: A Weekend at the Lake


Week of March 27th: TV Evening

Sometimes, our dates are super exciting like staying in a cabin at a lake (or at least that's exciting for me!). Other weeks, we are busy and tired from our last date and don't want to go anywhere. Sure, the lake was fun and it was relaxing to get away from home, but on the other hand that meant that we gave up our weekend chore time and had a lot to catch up on the following week. So, this week we decided to take it easy and relax with a new (old) TV show that we just started watching: Silicon Valley. R thinks it's hilarious because he gets all the nerdy tech jokes. I like the first two episodes that we watched together and then promptly stopped watching. Personally, I'd prefer to watch Gilmore Girls over just about anything else but can't usually talk R into watching with me ;)
