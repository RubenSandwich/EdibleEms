I don't miss bread since I (mostly) gave it up over a year ago. But I do miss crispy, breaded chicken! It is one of the best inventions ever, in my opinion. Here's how i enjoy crispy chicken without all of the unnecessary carbs.

	Directions:

1. Mix together the egg, honey, and vinegar and place in a shallow dish. Mix the coconut flakes with salt & pepper and place in another shallow dish.

2. Dip coconut tenders in egg mixture.

3. Dip coconut flakes in the coconut flake mixture and place on a pre-greased baking sheet or dish.

4. Bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes (may be longer or shorter depending on your oven, use a meat thermometer to double check). Flip the chicken tenders over halfway.
