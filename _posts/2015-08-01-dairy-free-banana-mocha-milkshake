Sometimes, you just need a **milkshake**. That is one of the treats I miss the most after becoming dairy-free. So much so that I set out to create a substitute. 

<br>

And boy, did I do good!

	Ingredients:


* 1 frozen banana 
* 1/8 cup [coffee concentrate](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/cold-brew-coffee)
* 1 T cocoa powder
* 2 T coconut milk (optional, depending on how thick you want your milkshake - the banana makes it creamy and "milky" already)
* Pinch of salt

<br>

	Directions:

Mix all ingredients through coconut milk in a blender until there are no chunks and it is creamy. Stir in a pinch of salt at the end.
