The thing I love to do most, even more than cooking and creating recipes, is organizing. Making meal plans is not only one of my strengths, but it is actually fun to me. 

I know that the effort required to plan meals ahead is enough to make most people give up before they even try. I admit that it does take preparation and thinking ahead to cook things yourself, but it is honestly so worth it. I know you know that too, but I also know motivation can be hard to come by.

Since I love to make meal plans and I make one every single week (no I am not exaggerating - I've been doing it ever since I got my own place!), I thought why not just share it? I'm sure a lot more people would cook for themselves if they just had a template to follow. 

So here it is, all of my ideas, notes, and links to recipes whenever relevant. I literally used this meal plan myself so I know it's practical and easy. Let me know what you think!

![Sample Spring Meal Plan.png](/content/Sample-Spring-Meal-Plan.png)

Here are the details and my notes about each recipe:

*Sunday*

	Breakfast:

Since I have a little extra time on weekend mornings, I like to make a nice breakfast and always make sure to make extra 						for the week. This week I had some leftover **goat cheese** (the only dairy I can tolerate well) from a pizza Ruben & I had Saturday night, so I used that along with **fresh herbs** and **onions** to make a **frittata**. 



![IMG_20150301_075459_731.jpg](/content/IMG_20150301_075459_731.jpg)



<div style="color: blue;">For the frittata, I mixed together eggs w/coconut milk and fresh herbs, then added them to a cast iron skillet where I had chopped onions sautéing. I let the sides firm up for a couple of minutes, then transferred the skillet to the oven and baked at 325 for about 10 minutes.</div>

<br>

	Lunch:

We attend a small group at our church on Sunday afternoons and we all eat lunch together. This week we brought a **salad** (romaine, red onion, & olives) and **fruit** while another family made **breakfast for lunch** (pancakes, bacon, & eggs).

	Dinner: 

Every couple of weeks or so I **roast a whole chicken**, either in my crockpot or the oven. This way we have leftover chicken for days. *If you have kids, you can roast two chickens at once – it is hardly any less work and saves a lot of energy too.* 

Side dishes included **roasted cabbage wedges** *(As an option instead of lettuce wraps, you can keep a few of the outer leaves for cabbage wraps later in the week.)*, and **sweet potatoes**, sliced thinly and fried in **coconut oil**.
<br>
<div style="color: blue;">The cabbage wedges were baked at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes.</div>
<br>

*Monday*


	Breakfast: 

Weekday mornings are rushed for me, especially Mondays for some reason. I just grabbed **leftover frittata** from yesterday and reheated it. I sautéed some **cabbage** in coconut oil too, to get some extra veggies in and because eggs don’t fill me up enough.



![IMG_20150302_071311_793.jpg](/content/IMG_20150302_071311_793.jpg)



	Lunch:

On Sunday night I made the leftover chicken into a **chicken salad** with jarred, marinated **artichoke hearts** and the leftover **olives** from Sunday lunch. That, plus an **apple** made a great lunch.



![IMG_20150301_181704_283.jpg](/content/IMG_20150301_181704_283.jpg)


Dinner:

Tilapia is something we have often because it is super inexpensive and has a mild flavor so it can pair with almost anything. Tonight we had **baked tilapia** with **rice** and **cream of spinach soup**.   
<br>
<div style="color: blue;">To bake the tilapia, I just squeezed some lemon juice on top, added salt & pepper, and baked at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.</div>



The cream of spinach soup came from a Rachael Ray magazine. If you google it, though, you can find a recipe pretty easily. 



![IMG_0886.JPG](/content/IMG_0886-JPG.jpg)



*Tuesday*

	Breakfast:

**Ground sausage** cooks very quickly and makes a great breakfast alternative to eggs, which I sometimes get bored of. Add **kale**, **onions**, **salt & pepper** and you’ve got a great **breakfast hash**!



![IMG_20150303_064928_870.jpg](/content/IMG_20150303_064928_870.jpg)



	Lunch:

Monday night I threw together **Nori rolls**, which is sushi without the rice (although if you add rice it would still be a great lunch). It’s no more difficult to make than a sandwich and is much healthier. I filled **nori paper** with **avocado** (not in season but I crave them sometimes), **cucumber**, **carrots**, and **canned salmon**. You could use fresh salmon too if you’re not cheap like me. *(Make sure to dip the long edge of the nori paper in rice vinegar so it sticks together.)*



![IMG_0890.JPG](/content/IMG_0890-JPG.jpg)



I also ate leftover **spinach soup**.

	Snack:

**Larabars** are my go to snack if I don’t have time to make my own granola bars <div style="color: red;">(recipe to come soon!).</div>

	Dinner:

Chickpeas are my favorite legume and really the only one I digest easily for whatever reason. Tonight we had a **stir fry** with **chickpeas**, **broccoli,** fresh **lemon juice**, **garlic**, and **onions**. I served this with a **green salad** (using leftover greens from Sunday’s lunch plus any other veggies we had lying around). **Whole carrots** are still in season so I’ve been buying them pretty much every week. They are so beautiful and taste great too. We had regular carrots this week as a second side dish.


<div style="color: blue;">Roast the carrots at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.</div>
<br>

*Note: Save the broccoli stems! They add a great crunch to salads and also work for soups and green juices.*


![IMG_20150303_181448_428.jpg](/content/IMG_20150303_181448_428.jpg)



*Note: I made extra stir fry for lunch on Wednesday.*

*Wednesday*

	Breakfast:

Same as yesterday. I have a breakfast sausage hash 2-3 times a week, usually. Sometimes I add a nice runny **fried egg**, as in the picture below.





![IMG_20150304_061823_400.jpg](/content/IMG_20150304_061823_400.jpg)





	Lunch:

Leftover stir fry with **sugar snap peas**.

	Snack: 

**Apple**

	Dinner: 

Since today was a long day for me, I don’t feel like cooking anything fancy. I made a quick stir fry with **ground meat**, 	**onions**, **garlic**, and **leftover cabbage** and used leftover **lettuce** to make **lettuce wraps**. You can also make them with cabbage, which is sturdier, but we already have had a good amount of cabbage this week. ☺



![IMG_20150304_185004_495.jpg](/content/IMG_20150304_185004_495.jpg)



*Note: I also made double so I could have some for lunch tomorrow too.*

To make it an extra comforting meal, I made **turmeric milk** from this website:

http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-16564/balancing-detoxifying-hot-spiced-turmeric-milk.html

	Dessert: 

**Applesauce**, heated with **cinnamon**. 	

*Thursday*

	Breakfast:

Another quick weekday breakfast: **scrambled eggs** w/sauteed greens. I used **collard greens** because they are in season.
	
	Lunch:

Leftover lettuce wraps with an **apple**.
	
	Snack: 

Another **larabar.**

	Dinner:

I love pork chops because they cook so quickly and are a great, hearty dinner that seems fancier than it really is. I have this great recipe in one of my cookbooks for **cinnamon rubbed pork chops** that I used this week.



![IMG_0902.JPG](/content/IMG_0902-JPG.jpg)



<div style="color: blue;">To make the cinnamon rubbed pork chops, you really do not need the recipe. Here’s a quick summary:</div>


1.	<div style="color: blue;">Rub pork chops w/cinnamon, paprika, salt & pepper.</div>

2.	<div style="color: blue;">Brown chops on both sides in a cast iron skillet.</div>

3.	<div style="color: blue;">Transfer to oven in the cast iron skillet at bake at 400 degrees for about 10-12 minutes.</div>


As a side dish I made **cocoa roasted cauliflower** (to keep with the sweet-savory theme) from this recipe:

http://theclothesmakethegirl.com/2011/01/11/cocoa-toasted-cauliflower/



Other side dishes included **kale chips** from the leftover kale....



![IMG_0908.JPG](/content/IMG_0908-JPG.jpg)



....and a bowl of **strawberries**.

*Friday*

	Breakfast:

Same as yesterday.

	Lunch:

Leftovers

	Dinner:

Another **stir fry**! Sometimes I feel like doing something fun and elaborate on a Friday night and sometimes I am tired and just want something quick. After a long week this week, it was nice to be able to whip up dinner without much effort tonight. <div style="color: blue;">I sautéed seasonal leeks with garlic and thinly sliced beef tip steak in sesame oil, served it over rice, and it was great.</div>



![IMG_0917.JPG](/content/IMG_0917-JPG.jpg)


	Dessert:

It is Friday night, after all, so we like to have a little treat. We still had one jar left of my **3-Ingredient Canned Peaches** (http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/three-ingredient-canned-peaches), so...<div style="color: blue;">we poured the peaches over **coconut cream** that I froze in a small baking pan for about 30 minutes then blended it to give it that ice cream consistency, and **cinnamon** sprinkled on the top.</div>



![IMG_0913.JPG](/content/IMG_0913-JPG.jpg)



![IMG_0919.JPG](/content/IMG_0919-JPG.jpg)



Didn’t turn out pretty on the picture, but it was so perfect tasting!

*Saturday*

	Breakfast:
	
Saturday mornings are lazy mornings so I have more time to make a fancy breakfast. Ruben loves crepes and I figure they’re healthy (they’re basically eggs & milk), so I made **crepes** (http://againstallgrain.com/2013/01/26/crepes-grainfree-paleo/) with **pureed strawberries**, which are in season in spring, and a glaze of **maple syrup** (optional).



![IMG_0921.JPG](/content/IMG_0921-JPG.jpg)



	Lunch:

**Green soup**, inspiration from (http://www.ancestralizeme.com/drink-your-vegetables-with-green-soup/ ) using leftover veggies w/**chicken caesar salad** using leftover chicken from Sunday. <div style="color: red;">I will have a formal, written up recipe for the dairy-free chicken casear salad coming soon. (It just needs a bit of tweaking first!)</div>



![IMG_0927.JPG](/content/IMG_0927-JPG.jpg)




My "green soup" turned out more purple because of the purple cabbage I added but it still tasted great.



We also snacked on **Jackson's Honest potato chips**. I love this brand because they cook the potatoes in coconut oil and salt only. They are a really high quality, clean snack that is a bit expensive but nice for a treat on a Saturday night.



![IMG_0928.JPG](/content/IMG_0928-JPG.jpg)




	Dinner:

Leftovers! Spend less time cooking and more time with loved ones this evening. Or find another fun recipe to cook with someone you love. ☺
