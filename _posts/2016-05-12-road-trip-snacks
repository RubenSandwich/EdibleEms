As you have probably seen from me posting all over [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/eatwithemilynic/), Snapchat (@eatwithemily), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/eatwithemilynic/?ref=badge), I am heading to Boston today!! Follow along with my trip on any or all of those social media accounts, and look for my very first VLOG of a recap when I return! 

In the meantime, I thought I'd show the snacks I brought to get me through a **9-hour** bus ride (joy!). Even though I was on a bus for almost a full day, I'd say I ate pretty well. :)

<br>

1.) Nutbutter

Filled with protein, healthy fats, and amazing flavor, nut butters are some of my (and many others') favorite traveling snacks!

[Justin's Brand](http://justins.com) is my absolute favorite brand of clean nut butters that come in [little packets](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ATEZOG?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B002ATEZOG&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) perfect for traveling! They also have a ton of fun flavors like [chocolate hazelnut butter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00II0XHZO?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00II0XHZO&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20), [honey peanut butter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E1XPYB2?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00E1XPYB2&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20), and for a treat they even sell [mini peanut butter cups](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012H9HGSU?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B012H9HGSU&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) (just like Reese's but way less junky!).

2.) Jerky/Meat Sticks

I argued with Ruben about what the heck these things are called. We couldn't come to a better description other than meat sticks, which is a phrase I really hate. Doesn't that sound so unappealing? Well, the actually are not and them, along with item #1 and some item #3 made for our lunch today! Ruben likes the [cracked pepper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KPT8TUE?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00KPT8TUE&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) while I prefer the [honey mustard](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RVT7AII?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00RVT7AII&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20).

3.) Fruit & pre-cut veggies.

*Carrots, zucchini, celery, and cucumber all do surprisingly well when traveling for a day trip, and will last several days in a fridge!*

<br>

This one is so obvious, but I had to put it in. Do not forget about pre-cut veggies! For example, Trader Joe's sells pre-cut jicama, which is so juicy and refreshing on car trips, especially compared to all of the salty foods typical for traveling.

<br>

4.) Clean granola bars

It's sad that I have to specify that granola bars need to be *clean,* but so often I pick up the package of a healthy looking granola bar and in reality it is full of junk.

I found these [Simple Squares](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IYQ2N9I?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00IYQ2N9I&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) at our local grocery store in Pittsburgh and LOVE THEM. They are completely **paleo-friendly** too, which is a huge plus for those with allergies. :) If I ever move I will have to order them in bulk because I am seriously addicted.

<br>

5.) Dark chocolate!

This one is probably also obvious. :) But as I learned from [my cross country road trip](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/travel-with-emily-cross-country-road-trip), it it ALWAYS NECESSARY to take something sweet with you, if you have any kind of sweet cravings like I do! All of the junky grab foods and chocolate bars at gas stations become surprisingly tempting when you've been on the road all day. Trust me. Better to bring your own.  

P.S. Always buy fair trade chocolate. [Theo](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HHEBD4?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B004HHEBD4&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) and [Endangered Forest](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TN02XG?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B002TN02XG&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) are two brands I see at nearly every grocery store.
