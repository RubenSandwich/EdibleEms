If you know me pretty well or even if you’ve just met me, than you probably know how much I love to be outdoors. I’m not a serious outdoorswoman or a huge thrill seeker, but I love to be in nature doing an easy walk or resting and reading by a river somewhere.

Now that fall has came and gone and winter is quickly picking up, weather has cooled and it’s starting to become harder to enjoy the outdoors even though a lot of us want and honestly mean to. 

<br>

**Here are a couple of ways that I still manage to enjoy the outdoors while temperatures are dropping:**

<br>

1.You don’t have to be outside all day to see a benefit! Even 30 minutes of walking in our neighborhood park can leave me feeling so refreshed. Still think that isn't enough? Try going outside twice a day for 20-30 minutes a day instead of in one long chunk. Go to a park close to your house and just go twice, morning and night. What else are Saturdays for?


2. Bundle up! So obvious but a good coat, shoes, and long underwear can make a world of difference.


3. Bring nature to your house (or office). Scatter plants throughout the area you spend the most time in. 


4. Pretend! Pull a comfy armchair up right next to the window with the best view in the house, surround it with plants in all directions, grab a blanket, and bask in the nature while sitting on your own comfy chair. Book optional.
