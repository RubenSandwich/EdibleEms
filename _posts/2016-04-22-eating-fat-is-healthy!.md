Lately, I've been craving avocado like crazy! Partly it is probably the season, but it also may be that my body just needs that healthy source of fat!

One topic that I see a lot of confusion around is **how to incorporate fat in a healthy way into our diet.** I think the days of fat-phobia thinking that all fat is bad are over (I think...), so people are starting to wake up to realize that humans need fat for our cells. But there is still a lot of confusion around **what kinds of fat are good for us.**

I've assembled a list of and links to all of the healthy fats that I include in my diet on a regular basis (except avocados & eggs, you can find those anywhere :P ). Sure, there are more, but these are the ones I find most accessible, relatively affordable, and easy to use. 


<br>

	Healthy Fats I Use Regularly:



<br>

1.) Olive oil

This is a great alternative to store bought dressings, but I will say that olive oil does not work well in high heat, so it is better to be used cold than for cooking. I still use it for cooking once in a while, but I try not to fry things in it.

I usually [buy it in large jars](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PL0OCGW?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00PL0OCGW&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) to save money. A lot of grocery stores have bulk olive oil now too so you can just buy one jar and then refill it every time you need more!

*I found this large tin at Whole Foods.*

2.) Butter from grass fed cows or ghee

We really need to bring butter back! As long as it is minimally processed and from a natural source (grass fed cows), butter actually has a lot of health benefits, including Vitamin K2 which is hard to find anywhere else. It's great for cooking anything in, drizzling over vegetables, and adding to mashed sides such as potatoes, parsnips, sweet potatoes, and other starchy vegetables.

[Kerrygold](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNPHNA?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B001LNPHNA&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) is a great brand which you can either order from online, or find in certain stores (I know my local Trader Joe's sells it but I'm not sure if they all do).

3.) Avocado

This one needs no explanation, but I just thought I would add it in here because who doesn't love avocados??

4.) Coconut everything!

The most common use for coconut is [coconut oil](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OH7ZCG4?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00OH7ZCG4&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) which can be used both for baking and for cooking anything with in a frying pan. I solely buy [Trader Joe's brand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OH7ZCG4?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00OH7ZCG4&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20), which you can actually order from Amazon if there is no store near you, or if you want to [order in bulk](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OH7ZCG4?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00OH7ZCG4&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) and save money. This is a much **safer alternative for cooking** as it has a high heat point (does not get damaged when heated up as olive oil does). 

I also love coconut flakes to make macaroons (recipe forthcoming!), [coconut butter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018SRNCD8?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B018SRNCD8&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20), [coconut cream](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A6BHDOE?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00A6BHDOE&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) (I use it for whipped cream and dairy free frosting recipes), and [coconut milk](http://www.amazon.com/Native-Forest-Organic-Classic-13-5-oz/dp/B001HTJ2BQ/ref=pd_sim_sbs_325_2?ie=UTF8&dpID=51km-xzvSzL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR105%2C160_&refRID=0TFESD0N632P3MSEKJD2), which I use as a replacement for cow's milk.

5.) Lard

Believe it or not, lard from **properly raised pigs** (i.e. pastured, organic, unrefined) can be a great alternative fat source for people who do not like the taste of coconut, cannot do dairy, or just to mix it up. I do not use lard very frequently, but when I do, it is always with **homemade potato fries.** :)

I use [this brand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LOMONCO?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00LOMONCO&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20) from Whole Foods (which you can also [order online](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LOMONCO?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00LOMONCO&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20)).

6.) Egg yolks

Please don't throw these away! Egg yolks are definitely an example of a healthy fat to incorporate into your diet, as well as a great source of folate, Vitamin B12, protein and lots more, as I read about in [Eat The Yolks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1628600195?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1628600195&linkCode=xm2&tag=edib0a-20). I am working on writing a review of this book, as it has been pivotal in my health journey and I think everyone should read it too!

*Eat the whole eggs, guys!*

**I'd also love to know, what are your favorite healthy fats to cook with and eat?**
