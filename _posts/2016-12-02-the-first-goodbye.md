I started crying almost as soon as Ruben and I got into my bedroom and closed the door. I was about to leave to be on staff at Black Lake Bible Camp again for three months. He held me for who knows how long, while I cried and made him feel horrible about not coming with me. I couldn’t help it - I was so attached after just 1 short year! But the thought of not seeing him on a weekly (or more) basis made camp seem like a bad decision. Even once a week was not enough seeing each other - how can I now go a whole summer with only 1 or 2 visits? 


Camp was harder than ever this year as I was responsible for 13 teenagers, 8 girls and 5 boys. Each of them were struggling with their own issues, many of them ones I had or even still was experiencing. Walking through these issues with our fathers, friendships, and anxiety gave me a way to get clarity on them myself, which was amazing. But it also took a huge emotional toll on my and, unlike usual, I did not have Ruben there to fall back on.


I had become so emotionally dependent on Ruben and the calm comfort he always brought me. A good thing in a relationship, but I realized that maybe I had gone too far in relying on him to hold me up. It’s a delicate balance that I am still learning of resting in each other while remaining strong in yourself. 


The negative effects of being apart were surprising, too. We got annoyed at each other more, even though we hardly saw each other. Things we said on the phone were misinterpreted. This pattern is something I have continued to see through marriage as we go through periods of not seeing each other much or spending enough time together and things quickly start to fall apart. Time together helps so much with seemingly unrelated issues, it is amazing. 


After that summer, I vowed that our relationship would not be a distance one, or one that was tolerant of long absences. Yes, it it fine and even good to spend some time apart sometimes, but every relationship is different and ours was not one which thrived with much absence. People give us flack for it, but we just don’t like to be apart and that is it. Nothing wrong with that. Some relationships can’t help it due to jobs or circumstances, but we make staying together a priority for ourselves and it works for us.
