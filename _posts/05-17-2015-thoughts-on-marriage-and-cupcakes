This week I feel particularly sentimental as I just celebrated my one year anniversary with my wonderful husband. I felt like that was worth a blog post look back into the day of the wedding and some insights I've gained since.

Cooking is my therapy. 

Most people find it stressful to cook after a long day, but I guess I am lucky in that it is one of the most relaxing things I can do. I love working with my hands while also being creative and at the end of it getting a great reward that I can eat! 

With that in mind, people might understand why I decided to make my own wedding cake. 

*The night before my wedding.* 

It was not stressful at all for me, and even helped calm my nerves as I measured and chatted with my bridesmaid who was staying with me that night. What better way to spend your last night as an unmarried woman? :)

I love to reminisce, and I love pictures, so if you don't mind here are some pictures of our wedding day:

Oh these make me so happy... :)

 <span style="font-size: 20px;">**The Food**</span>

Anyway, the dessert was definitely the main part of our wedding reception as we did not have dancing and held a picnic style theme. We did serve small **"tea sandwiches"** from our local grocery store New Seasons, along with **fresh apples** my mom brought from Tree Top, where she works in Eastern Washington. All of the food was regionally located and all of the desserts were homemade. Many of my friends and family were so gracious to help with the **dessert bar** by bringing a dessert. I could not have ordered anything better or more special from any bakery!

As drinks we served various flavors of **lemonade** to continue with the summery/picnic theme.

 <span style="font-size: 20px;">**The Favors**</span>

As a tea lover, I had wanted to serve hot tea, but the weather was 75 degrees on the day of our wedding, so we ended up serving lemonade as described above, but keeping the mismatched mugs I bought and giving them out as wedding favors.

The food and other details were a small part of our wedding, but really helped bring people together and create a casual environment where people felt comfortable enough to stay, enjoy each other, and celebrate, which is all I wanted for the day.

 <span style="font-size: 20px;">**One Year Later**</span>

To celebrate our one year anniversary, Ruben and I re-created our wedding cake. No, I did not create the recipe (I wish I was better at baking!), but used a recipe for a grain free **lemon cake** from one of my cookbooks and topped it with whipped **coconut cream** (I have developed a dairy intolerance since the wedding) and **fresh strawberries** (which are in season right now too). Sweet, yet not too rich and perfectly springtime appropriate. 

It was fun to make together and brought back a lot of happy memories.

 <span style="font-size: 20px;">**Marriage**</span>

I get a lot of questions about marriage and how it differs from being single. People usually seem to be shy about asking these questions, often starting with *"You don't have to answer this*" or *"Do you mind if I ask..."* I guess many people do not want to share details of their most intimate relationship, which I get, but honestly I really enjoy sharing about my marriage. I would not ever want to say anything Ruben would be uncomfortable with, but at the same time I am not going to keep quiet about the most important relationship of my life! 

It is a fine line between sharing my personal information and also keeping Ruben's privacy. I am more than happy to talk about what I feel is appropriate and share my general thoughts. I especially love doing this one-on-one with a friend over tea in a cozy coffee shop. :)

Anyway, here are the big realizations I have come to this year. Different than I would have guessed and different from anything anybody told me to expect, so realize this is just my experience and I cannot speak for all.

<br>

 <div style="color: blue;">1. It is actually very difficult to spend time together as a married couple.</div>

<br>

You would think we live together, so we see each other all the time and want our own space sometimes. While I definitely do need alone time as an introvert, spending time with Ruben has become more of a need than my alone time since being married.

We both spend all day doing completely different things and only get a few hours in the evenings to do house chores, life tasks, get ready for the next day, and then finally spend time together. Often times we are so tired that we end up mindlessly scanning the internet and then all of a sudden it is time to go to bed and we have hardly even spoken. 

This is not an intentional thing, but just happens naturally to us. I have been so surprised to find that in order to spend quality time together, we have to *intentionally try* to set aside time to do so. 

<span style="font-size: 18px;">We can go *days* without really ever having a genuine conversation about life and things besides work. </span>

I do not think this is only us. You hear about couples going on "date night" and trying to spend time together that way. I will tell you though, **date night is not enough.** You need time to connect on a regular basis. I do not know why this is, but once we got married that one-on-one emotional connection suddenly became a need as important as eating.

<br>

<div style="color: blue;">2. The highs are higher and the lows are lower.</div>

<br>

I stole this wording from Ruben, but I think it is wonderfully put (he has always been so much better with words than I am). Marriage has definitely been a series of up and downs, way more so than when we were dating or even engaged. 

<br>


 <div style="color: blue;">3. Mundane is fun!</div>

<br>

I think there is an unspoken fear among many people that once you get married, the fun and interesting part is over. Actually my experience has been that it gets better every day! Being married allows us to have many more spontaneous outings and  do fun things without having to plan every single time we are together. 


There is also a lot of mundane as we live life together, day-by-day, spending most of our time working and doing chores. This is not a bad change, as it has taught us to appreciate the ordinary and relish in our new routines.

<br>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">So that's what I think about that! Thanks for letting me blabber about my wedding and all this touchy-feely stuff.</span>
