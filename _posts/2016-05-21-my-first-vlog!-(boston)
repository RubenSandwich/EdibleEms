Last week, my husband and I skipped out of work early on Thursday, packed our [road trip snacks](http://emily.rubennic.com/recipes/road-trip-snacks), and took a 9-hour trip to Boston for our 2-year anniversary!

We took the most brilliant form of public transportation, something called the [Mega Bus](https://www.megabus.com), which is a cheap way to travel in a surprisingly comfortable double-decker bus with wifi and skylight windows! It's not on the west coast sadly, but if you ever do an east coast trip and want to see multiple cities, I highly recommend it.

**New York City**

You thought this post was about Boston? Us lucky ducks also got to spend a whopping 2 hours in NYC along the way! Our bus transfer was in NYC so we got to see a few sights on our way between buses:

**West Coast Friends on the East Coast**

Our first day we actually met up with some friends from Portland, who were there for Erica's graduation for her Master's Degree! It was lovely celebrating with her and being able to catch up with the two of them.

**History and Stuff**

One of my favorite things we saw was the Boston Tea Party Ships.

**The Somewhat Cheesy but Also Special Memory-Filled Video**


Here's a quick video recap of some of the sights that are just too hard to describe.
