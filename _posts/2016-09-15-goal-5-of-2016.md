To clarify on this goal as I did for [goal #4], I must say that I do not expect to right away grow ALL of my own vegetables. I just meant that I wanted to try to grow some.

And I did!

But mostly I just grew herbs. Because they're easier. And WAY TOO EXPENSIVE at the store! Seriously, for being the second-easiest things I've grown (first being lettuce), herbs are way overpriced and I am growing my own from here on out!

Take a tour of my "garden" composed of entirely pots and zero yard space here:
