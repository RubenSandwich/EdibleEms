I'm in no way a professional cook, baker, or photographer in any way, but is simply passionate about health and can't stop talking about food! This site is a tool for her to share what she is learning as well as tips and tricks for making healthy living a part of one's lifestyle.

Recently, Em became certified as a CHEK Holistic Lifestyle Coach through the [CHEK Institute](http://chekinstitute.com) and has started one-on-one coaching and teaching classes/workshops.

### A Bit More About Em

- Em is a civil engineer working in medical building construction and focusing on sustainable design.
- Em moved from Portland, OR to Pittsburgh, PA just for the heck of it just over 1 year ago!
- Em loves to cook but baking really isn't her thing. (One exception: my Chocolate Cake recipe!)
- Em teaches wellness classes at her local gym.
- She is the youngest of 4 but was raised as an only child since her siblings are 10+ years older than her.
- Em moved 7 times growing up, so she never knows what to say when people ask where she’s from!
- The only thing Em loves more than preparing a special dish for her friends and loved ones is eating!
