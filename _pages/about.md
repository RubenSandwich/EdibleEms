##### A Bit More About Em
\- During the week, Em works as a civil engineer focusing on sustainable construction.
\- Em moved from Portland, OR to Pittsburgh, PA just for the heck of it over 2 years ago!  
\- Em loves to cook but baking really isn't her thing. (One exception: her [Chocolate Cake](http://edibleem.com/dense-chocolate-cake-with-chocolate-drizzle) recipe.)  
\- Em teaches wellness classes at her [local gym](https://www.pittsburghfitnessproject.com/).  
\- She is the youngest of 4 but was raised as an only child since her siblings are 10+ years older than her.  
\- Em moved 7 times growing up, so she never knows what to say when people ask where sheâ€™s from!  
\- The only thing Em loves more than preparing a special dish for her friends and loved ones is eating!
